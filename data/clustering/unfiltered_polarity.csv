1159,Jay Z,December 4th,2002-11-12,America,"When you've got a nation of hustlers working for a small amount of slots, you learn something that you'll never learn at McDonald's. You learn to compete hard, even when you lose, because you can't settle for second-best as a hustler. It's not worth it. The only reason to do it is for the top slot, for the number one position... Sort of like the music business. *[The gang leader’s] hourly wage was $66…the foot soldiers earned just $3.30 an hour. In other words, a crack gang works pretty much like the standard capitalist enterprise: you have to be near the top of the pyramid to make a big wage…so if crack dealing is the most dangerous job in America, and if the salary is only $3.30 an hour, why on earth would anyone take the job?”","But I can’t say I’ve ever given much of a fuck about people who hear a curse word and start foaming at the mouth. The Fox News dummies. They wouldn’t know art if it fell on them.21Embed', ""Decoded: Part 2 (Excerpts) LyricsPart 2: I WILL NOT LOSEWhat's the basic motivation for a hustler? I hit the streets for the same reason a lot of other kids do: I wanted money and excitement and liked the idea of cutting myself loose from the rules and low ceilings of the straight world. The truth is that most kids on the corner aren't making big money--especially if you break their income down into hourly wage.* But they're getting rewarded in ways that go beyond dollars and cents. The kid on the streets is getting a shot at a dream. The dream is that he will be the only one to make this hustling thing pay off in a big way. He sees the guy who gets rich and drives the nice car and thinks, yep, that'll be me. He ignores the other stories going around, about dudes who get shot or beaten to death with bricks and chains. But they're working that corner for more than whatever small cut they get of the crack they sell--they're working because they're due for a miracle. The kid in McDonald's gets a check and that's it. There's no dream in fast food. Manager? That's a promotion not a dream. It took me a long time to realize how much courage it took to work at McDonald's, to walk through the streets past rows of hustlers wearing that orange uniform. But at the time, it seemed like an act of surrender to a world that hated us. I never even considered it a possibility.","--Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner,  Freakonomics1Embed"", ""Decoded: Part 3 (Excerpts) LyricsPart 3: POLITICS As USUAL Poor people in general have a twisted relationship with the government. We're aware of the government from the time we're born. We live in government-funded housing and work government jobs. We have family and friends spending time in the ultimate public housing, prison. We grow up knowing people who pay for everything with little plastic cards — Medicare cards for checkups, EBT cards for food. We know what AFDC and WIC stand for and we stand for hours waiting for bricks of government cheese. The first and fifteenth of each month are times of peak economic activity. We get to know all kinds of government agencies not because of civics class, but because they actually visit our houses and sit up on our couches asking questions. From the time we're small children we go to crumbling public schools that tell us all we need to know about what the government thinks of us.","{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.72, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9301}",0.16,0.12,0.72,0.9301

I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse. How then does the chief offender become the judge? Might does not necessarily mean right. Right is right. People forcibly reduced to sub-human existences, so that they behave in sub-human ways, helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity. People, like plants, grow where the light is. When you enclose a plant and limit its light source, it will bend itself toward the light, for the light is necessary for its survival.

1648,2Pac,2Pac Motivation interview,,America,"when I say ""we"", it\'s the good against evil. And what I mean we can take anything we want, we can take, we can have anything, because it belongs to you. If you\'re right and you got, good on your side, I really truly believe that nothing can stop you. And I\'m using the same thing as America taught me. That\'s what I\'m using the tools of this country, Capitalism and imperialism, colon-ism, I\'m using all those against them, and that\'s what they hate. They hate to see a little black kid sit in a first class with a gang in gold chains, gold rings you know what I\'m saying. The stewards staring at me .. they hate that.. they hate that shit so bad. They hate when I get off the plane and they lugging they luggage to go find a cab and I gotta car waiting for me with my name real  big, big African name ""Tupac"" they hate that I see it in their eyes. They hate that; when they see me in the restaurant or something wit a girl it\'s a black woman and I\'m sitting next to they hate that.. they hate.. they really hate when it\'s a white woman, but they won\'t see it.. they won\'t.. not from Tupac. So they hate that they see me with black woman they hate I don\'t say bitch, you know what I\'m saying?, to black females. I say bitch to white cops and the crooked cops that\'s who I say bitch to that\'s who is a bitch they hate that. They hate that; they can\'t limit me and hold me in one circle. They hate every time they tryna put me in gangsta category. I flip, do a summer song and end up in a juice category and I love that. I love that about myself, and I love that about black people. And If I can love... I\'m loving myself. I remember when I was poor I hated myself, now I love myself. So I see what the curse can do, and I see what it takes to get it off you.

Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists\' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac\'s – excuse me – Makaveli\'s verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.

He mentioned he had family and brothers in Staten Island that were putting this movement together, this Wu-Tang thing. So one day he invites me to go to the studio with him. I didn\'t go because I had to go to night school that evening. So the next day he had a tape of what they did the night before. And that tape was an unfinished version of ""Protect Yo Neck."" When I heard that, everything just became crystal clear now. I never missed another studio session after that. Whenever he told me he was going somewhere I was there. It inspired me to sit down. Let me just see if I can write something. I\'ve never written a rhyme before this. So that\'s what I did.

At this present time, I am currently in Cape Town, South Africa, and I\'m being prevented from leaving, unjustly, unlawfully, and without any logical reason. They\'re saying that they want to deport my family. Uh, they\'re making false claims against me, some of these government officials, even in the press are making false claims against me, saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious, which it is not. Anyone can do the research about the world passport; it\'s not a fictitious document. It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nation\'s state, at all. In fact, the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa, in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. You can see the stamps; they\'re there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate. To quote Lil Durk, I am not a liar. I\'ve made no false claims. I have not misrepresented myself. I\'m under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny, and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way I\'m being treated, because this is following no reasonable train of logic, as also, um...It\'s curious. I haven\'t broken any law, and I\'m being treated like a criminal. I know I\'m not unique in that regard, and I am grateful that I\'m here with my family. I haven\'t been physically harmed or anything like that. However, I have been detained. People in this state have taken punitive action against me, unnecessarily.

4058,Immortal Technique,Hollywood Drive By,2003-11-18,America,"To think about the origins of hip-hop in this culture and also about Homeland Security is to see that there are, at the very least, two worlds in America: one of the well-to-do and another of the struggling. For if ever there was the absence of homeland security, it is seen in the gritty roots of hip-hop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty. In the broader society, the opposite is true, for here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so widespread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. Their very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence, or the U.S Department of Justice. They're just words, they have very little relationship to reality. Now do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon?

We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the well-being of the people; it's only about profit. Everything else—their image, their human resources, their public relations—only exist to protect the reality behind it. Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us, and so they privatized everything. Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart. They didn't care about our survival or well-being—they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources. They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism, and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them.

4081,Immortal Technique,Open Your Eyes,2011-10-27,America,"And while some used missionaries and donations to off-set this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease, and sanctions that killed millions. They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enabled them, and stored them and kept them in power. They became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, governments of thievery. They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits. The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy, and even overthrow democratically elected governments. And so the age of revolution began again. They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market. But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself. It is manipulated like a puppet, and it survives because of its image. Destroy the image, and the enemy will die. Such is the same in the rap industry. But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World. When they need new assets, new artists to prostitute a side-ins, and put on a shelf to use their songs; when they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the Third World. They took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us. But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need them to succeed. They're no better than us. Their economic advertising was always a lie. A few got rich, but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure. Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelry, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide genes, 20-year contracts, and oil blood money. Build your defenses, my independent brothers and sisters. They’ll stop at nothing to get what they want. They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward. But the super powers are no less corrupt; they've just learned to disguise it better, ‘cause they fix elections too, they embezzle tax money, they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit. And when there's enough at stake, history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own presidents",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
