3998,2Pac,2Pac Motivation interview,,America,"when I say ""we"", it\'s the good against evil. And what I mean we can take anything we want, we can take, we can have anything, because it belongs to you. If you\'re right and you got, good on your side, I really truly believe that nothing can stop you. And I\'m using the same thing as America taught me. That\'s what I\'m using the tools of this country, Capitalism and imperialism, colon-ism, I\'m using all those against them, and that\'s what they hate. They hate to see a little black kid sit in a first class with a gang in gold chains, gold rings you know what I\'m saying. The stewards staring at me .. they hate that.. they hate that shit so bad. They hate when I get off the plane and they lugging they luggage to go find a cab and I gotta car waiting for me with my name real  big, big African name ""Tupac"" they hate that I see it in their eyes. They hate that; when they see me in the restaurant or something wit a girl it\'s a black woman and I\'m sitting next to they hate that.. they hate.. they really hate when it\'s a white woman, but they won\'t see it.. they won\'t.. not from Tupac. So they hate that they see me with black woman they hate I don\'t say bitch, you know what I\'m saying?, to black females. I say bitch to white cops and the crooked cops that\'s who I say bitch to that\'s who is a bitch they hate that. They hate that; they can\'t limit me and hold me in one circle. They hate every time they tryna put me in gangsta category. I flip, do a summer song and end up in a juice category and I love that. I love that about myself, and I love that about black people. And If I can love... I\'m loving myself. I remember when I was poor I hated myself, now I love myself. So I see what the curse can do, and I see what it takes to get it off you. It just takes a little confidence, and that\'s what we missing as black people. We let them make us feel like you know, a quiet again. Just being a quiet, you know what I\'m saying, telling you that when good chains is hoochie. And that\'s played out, cause they make jokes about it. You know boohubhubahubhuba, really!

At this present time, I am currently in Cape Town, South Africa, and I\'m being prevented from leaving, unjustly, unlawfully, and without any logical reason. They\'re saying that they want to deport my family. Uh, they\'re making false claims against me, some of these government officials, even in the press are making false claims against me, saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious, which it is not. Anyone can do the research about the world passport; it\'s not a fictitious document. It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nation\'s state, at all. In fact, the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa, in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. You can see the stamps; they\'re there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate. To quote Lil Durk, I am not a liar. I\'ve made no false claims. I have not misrepresented myself. I\'m under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny, and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way I\'m being treated, because this is following no reasonable train of logic, as also, um...It\'s curious. I haven\'t broken any law, and I\'m being treated like a criminal. I know I\'m not unique in that regard, and I am grateful that I\'m here with my family. I haven\'t been physically harmed or anything like that. However, I have been detained. People in this state have taken punitive action against me, unnecessarily. There\'s no reason I have to spend any time in the cell. There\'s no reason I had to have police come to my house, damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport, where nobody arrested me, and none of that ever happened, at all. This is not an administration of justice, and all I seek is to leave the state. I\'m not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that. People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing, because I\'m not- I just wanna go home, and I don\'t live in America, and I have the right to domicile wherever I please, without fear or without interference",No more parties in SA,,"{'neg': 0.269, 'neu': 0.366, 'pos': 0.365, 'compound': 0.2006}",0.365,0.269,0.366,0.2006
