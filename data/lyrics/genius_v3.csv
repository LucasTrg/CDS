blade\nAnd they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice\nSo that only the blade is protruding\nAnd that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat\nAnd it'll come and lick the blade, trying to eat\nAnd what happens is when the wolf licks the blade\nOf course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds\nAnd he thinks he's really having a good meal\nAnd he drinks, and he licks, and he licks\nAnd of course, he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself\nThat’s what the Imperialists did to us with crack cocaine\nYou got these young brothers out there thinking that they’re getting

something that’s bringing resources to them\nBut they're killing themselves just like the wolf was licking the blade\nAnd they're slowly dying without knowing it\nThat’s what’s happening to the

Lyrics[Intro]\nHelp me!\nYou ask me to help you?!\nMan is evil, capable of nothing but destruction!\n\n[Intro 2: Narrator]\nOnce upon a time\nThere was a very serious situation growing\nThere was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals\nAnd this is the story of their times\n\n[Verse 1: stic.man]\nOld man Sammy had a farm\nWalked the land with the rifle\nMost of the time shit was calm\nHis whole life was maintained off the everyday labor\nFrom the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable\nThis is how he kept food on his table (maxin\'!)\nYou would have thought he was disabled by the way he be relaxing\nActing like Mr. Magnificent\nBut the animals was thinkin\' somethin\' different\nThe sentiment was tension in the barnyard\nThroughout the years they had been through mad drama\nWith the farmer, word is bond, god\nAnd they all came to one conclusion\nThey argued there was no way they\'d ever be free\nIf it was up to humans\nTherefore the only course left was revolution which was understandable\nAnd since the pigs promised to lead it in the interest of all the animals\nThey planned a full attack\nUnder the leadership of Hannibal\nThe fattest pig in the pack\nThe next morning on the farm\nEverything was calm\nJust before dawn\nBut before long\nThe sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric\nNow check it\nThis is when that shit got hectic\nDirected by Hannibal, the animals attacked\nOld Sam was in a state of shock\nHe fell up on his back\nAnd dropped his rifle\nReachin\' in vain\nEach and every creature from the field at his throat\nScreamin\' ""Kill, feel the pain!""\n[Chorus: stic.man]\nThis is the animal in man\nThis is the animal in you\nThis is the animal in man\nComing true\nThis is the animal in man\nThis is the animal in you\nThis is the animal

his plans for power\nThat\'s when the conversation turned sour\nHe issued an official ordinance to set\nIf you not a pig from this day forth then you subordinate\nThat\'s when the horses went buckwild\nOne of them shouted out\n""You fraudulent pigs, we know your fucking style!""\nHannibal\'s face was flushed and pale\nAll the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal\nHe fell the same way Sam fell\nThey took his tongue out of his mouth\nAnd cut his body up for sale, for real\nYou better listen while you can\nIts a very thin line between animal and man\nWhen Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand\nWhat would you have done?\nShook his hand?\nThis is the animal in man\n[Chorus: stic.man]\nThis is the animal in man\nThis is the animal in you\nThis is the animal in

in America these days, but I really want to give you all a heads up. As you know I’ve been through three passports, 76 countries on the regular in the name of Hip-Hop since 1987 and in 2010, although I’ve never stopped traveling the earth this year, I’ve seen, heard and felt some new things\n\nAs far as RAP and HIP-HOP, it’s like USA Olympic basketball, the world has parity now and have surpassed the USA in ALL of the basic fundamentals of HIP-HOP – TURNTABLISM, BREAKING, GRAFFITI, and now EMCEEING with succinct mission , meaning and skill. Skill-wise rappers spitting three languages, have created super rappers to move the crowd with intensity and passion. The “arrogant” American comes in blackface, but if there was a HIP-HOP or Rap Olympics, I really don’t think the United States would get Gold, Silver or Brass or even ass for that sake\n\nPersonally, Public Enemy has been setting records in a record book that doesn’t really exist. The 20th year anniversary of FEAR OF A BLACK PLANET has become into a year and a half celebration of eights legs and five continents. All the while, looking at a HIP-HOP Planet across 25 countries while still somewhat supportive of American rap, the rest of the world has surpassed the U.S. in skill, in fundamentals and commitment to their communities. Public Enemy’s mission is to set the path, pave the road for cats to do their thing for a long time as long as they do it right\n\nBecause of the lack of support from local radio, television and community in the United States, the ability for “local” acts to thrive in their own radius has killed the ability to connect and grow into a proper development as a performer, entertainer and artist. Rappers trying to get put on to a national contract hustle from a NEW YORK or LOS ANGELES corporation has caused the art-form to atrophy from the bottom, while never getting signed to a top echelon that really doesn’t exist, but to a very few\n\nHIP-HOP NEWS spreads like any other mainstream NEWS in America. The garbage that’s unfit to print has now floated on websites and blogs like sh*t. For example a rapper working in the community gets obscured while if that same rapper robbed a gas station he’d get top coverage and be label a “rapper” while getting his upcoming or current music somewhat put on blast, regardless of its quality which of course is subjective like any other art. RAP sites and blogs are mimicking the New York POST\n\nThis is not mere complaint , this is truth and its coming down on Americans like rain without a raincoat with cats screaming how they ain’t wet. This is real. The other night upon finishing groundbreaking concert performances in Johannesburg we followed a special free concert in Soweto. To make a point that our agenda was to “show? and encourage the Hip-Hop community to be comfortable in its mind and skin without chasing valueless Amerikkkan values\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nIt does the people of the planet little good to hear that an an artist is famous and rich, will wear expensive jewelry straight from the mines, show it off, stay it the hotel, ride in limos, do the VIP with chilled champagne in the clubs, ape and monkey the chicks (meaning not even talking) and keep the dudes away with slave paid bodyguards when real people come close. The mimic of the VIACOM-sanctioned video has run tired, because it shows off, does NOT inspire and it says NOTHING\n\nHere in South Africa PUBLIC ENEMY has done crucial groundbreaking performances. Its the same level of smashing the house that we’ve done this year in Moscow, New York, Paris, London , Chicago and other places this year. This is not news We are not trying to prove any point other than to show that a classic work is timeless and doesn’t have a demographic per se. The Rolling Stones and U2 are NOT measured by mere tracks’ they are measured by the all-around event they present. The art of the performance has left Hip-Hop whereas somebody has led artists to do more performing off the stage than on it. The agenda here is to create artist exchange\n\nThis serves as a call to the infrastructure-less Hip-Hop game in Amerikkka. We know what your hustle is, but what is your work and job here? Faking it until making it runs its course in a recession, which is a depression for Black folks who increasingly are becoming more skill-less as they become jobless\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\nSince the music has so much power, and image has become everything to the point that it can dictate the direction of a person in their life\n\nIt is my mission now to really become a “freedom fighter” and stop this radiation. With Jay-Z and others who, for years would faint their worth, the statement of “with great power comes great responsibility,” is more true. Words are powerful and they can both start wars and bring peace. This cannot be taken lightly. Its important for the words to be body with the community. If not one dime of $250 million doesn’t benefit the people who contribute to it then why does that warrant coverage above the will and effort of many in the music who have done great things\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nI turned 50 this year. Everyday I get the question whats up with Hip-Hop today. If nothing was wrong the question wouldn’t be the dominating question I get. I do massive interviews worldwide. I’m covered from varied aspects Hip-Hop, Public Enemy, social issues, musicology in general. So, my interactive world dialogue is deeper and more present than 140 characters\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nI am tired of the silence of people that know better. There is nothing worse than a person that knows better and does worse. Or says nothing\n\nAnd makes excuses for bulls**t\n\nYou know damn well HIP-HOP in the USA has fell way the fuck off as the American dollar and much of America itself. Held up and dictated by White business lawyers, accountants in New York, and Los Angeles offices\n\nTo dictate to a community and not even live or be with the people is offensive. VIACOMs reach into Africa to turn HIP-HOP in to Amerfrica, which is as exploitative as those slave-makers who carried us across on boats. The decisions made in a boardroom in New York City while these cats scurry to their high rises, and suburban mansions from cultural profiteering must stop. And I’m going to do something about it\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nMy agenda of Hip-Hop around the world is in line with its creators, who followed Black Music. The music had the people’s back. It has never been my personal agenda. Americans arrogantly have no back. Hip-Hop has followed this. I am disturbed by the fact that I tell artists that doing work in their community will get them little or no buzz for their effort, but in the same sense if they robbed or shot someone or did a bid they would get national and sometimes international attention\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nSo many of your favorite people suck up to the NBA and NFL, because it has order and when you make the game look bad David Stern or Robert Goddell is kicking their asses out . They are the indisputable HWIC, and negroes are in line and silenced. But here in Hip-Hop the dysfunctionality reward makes the money that puts food on many tables\nIts time, because I hear too many excuses. I won't allow what’s in the USA f**k up what I and others worked hard to instill. I drive a ’94 Montero, a ’97 Acura, and have no expensive jewelry. There is nothing on this planet materially that is better than myself. This is what I instill in many doing Hip-Hop that nothing is greater than what is given. These games of people doing anything to get things has seeped into my way so therefore witness some radical virtual things coming from me in protecting the art-form of Hip-Hop\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nSo, I’m going after the few\n\nI’m tired of it\n\nChuck D from CaPEtown, South Africa\n\nPublic Enemy’s 71st Tour\n\n6th Leg of a Fear Of A Black Plan Tour1Embed"", 'But Can You Kill the Nigger in You?

They were our ROLE models. They gave us some of our richest support, and\nUncharacteristic of many advisors in this game, they led by EXAMPLE\n\nThe very first time the Beastie Boys headlined their own tour - the\nLicensed to Ill tour that hit the road in January of 1987 - they\nInvited us to join the bill. The line-up was the Beasties, Public\nEnemy, and Murphy\'s Law. Watching them tear it up... night after night... I learned so MUCH about the importance of a great stage show. THEY made me RE-think what Public Enemy was supposed to be doing onstage...and afFIRMED for me how imPORTANT our OWN Beastie Boy - who calls himself Flavor Flav - might be to our success. In that way, the Beastie Boys LITerally helped us to get OUR act together by MORE than living up to their name, night after night on the road. They were - and still ARE - one of the greatest live acts in music\n\nHow could we NOT Learn from way this group has CHALLENGED the conventions in the music business?...How they made their OWN rules about what it meant to be world class hip hop cats. After Licensed to Ill, the Beasties left the Def Jam label, and broke with their producer, Rick Rubin. EVERYONE wondered - and many people were pessimistic - about how the HELL they were going to top their multi-platinum debut. But their second album, Paul\'s Boutique broke the mold. With it, they accomplished EVERYTHING they\'d hoped for. They kept their band together through a challenging period, when most groups would have\nBroken up and gone home. They proved that they could produce\nThemSELVES when too many folks wrongly believed they were Rick\'s puppets. And they inSISted on maturing as a band and as human beings when the easier thing would have been to come back with a formula that might have been Licensed to Ill 2.0. It was that COURAGE and SELF-RESPECT that Public Enemy learned from, and so like them, we made SURE NEVER to take the easy way out just to repeat a hit record, never to compromise our faith in ourSELVES and in our ARTISTRY\n\nOne of the MOST ADmirable qualities about the Beastie Boys is that they\'ve stayed so TRUE to the game over the years, no matter WHAT was going on - with THEM, or hip-hop culture in GENERAL. As far as I\'M concerned, the trend towards individualism in hip-hop has become a PLAGUE. It has CRIPpled the art form. Yet through it all, the Beasties remain a TEAM of emcees, in the STYLE of the groups that INSPIRED them: the Treacherous Three, the Crash Crew, and the 2009 inductees, Run-DMC. And let us not forget their DJs throughout the years: Andre ""Doctor Dre"" Brown, DJ Hurricane; Mixmaster Mike, and DJ Double R, better known as Rick Rubin. In rock\'n\'roll, a band still gotta be a band. It\'s the same thing with hip-hop, and the Beasties remain a model for us ALL. BE together. PLAY together. STAY together. ToGETHER forEVER\n\nTime and again, in word and in practice, the Beastie Boys HONOR\nHip-hop\'s founding templates. As true musicians, they move beyond drum machines and repetitive samples, and sometimes pick up their own instruments. It\'s their way of paying TRIBUTE to the musicians who PRECEDED them, who built the founDAtions for hip-hop\n\nMore than many, many groups, The Beasties have evolved. In\nParticular, I\'m thinking of someone who wasn\'t able to join us tonight -- Adam Yauch, better known as MCA. But I feel him here tonight, because he belongs here with the GREATEST. It was MCA who COMMITTED the Beasties to their lengthy campaign for freedom for Tibet, a campaign that not only helped to shine a light on Tibet\'s struggle for independence, but allowed the Beasties to move from fighting for their right to party... to partying for their right to fight\nNo matter their lyrical subjects or their onstage parodies, ONE thing The Beastie Boys never were was a joke. They REMIND US that this is a CRAFT... not a hustle. I couldn\'t be more HONORED to INDUCT this group, because they represent the BEST of the hip hop and rap music. I dig, love, and always THANK them for doing the hard work of PAVING those roads... for musicians all over the world to rock rap and roll on...... ESPECIALLY before people took us seriously as artists\n\nMay we ALL be as PROFESSIONAL, DISTINCTIVE, POWERFUL, AND GROUND BREAKING as THIS group right here. The BEASTIE BOYS are INDEED ""three bad brothers.""

Wait, hold it. That\'s played out. Hit it!\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon\'t you give me all that jive about things you wrote before I\'s alive\n\'Cause this ain\'t 1823 -- ain\'t even 1970\nNow I\'m the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know\nSo every year just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme\n\nGonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good\nGonna rock shock clock it through your neighborhood\nGonna ring it, gonna sing it till it\'s understood\nMy rappin\' \'bout to happen like a knee you\'ve been slapping\nOr a toe you\'ve been tapping on a hunk of wood\n\n\'Bout a red-suited dude with a friendly attitude\nAnd a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block\nGot a long white beard, maybe looks kind a weird\nAnd if you ever see him, he can give you quite a shock\nNow people let me tell ya bout last year\nWhen the dude came flying over here\nWell, the hawk was out, snow\'s on the ground\nFolks stayed in to party down\nThe beat was thumping on the box, and I was dancing in my socks\nAnd the drummer played at a solid pace\nAnd a taste of the bass was in my face\nAnd the guitar player laid down the heavy layer\nOf the funky, junky rhythm of the disco beat\nAnd the guy with the 88\'s started to participate\nAnd I could sure appreciate a sound so sweet\n\nWe were all in the mood so we had a little food\nAnd a joke, and a smoke, and a little bit of wine\nWhen I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof\nCould it be or was it me? I was feeling super fine\nSo I went to the attic where I thought heard the static\nOn the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in\nBut the noise on the top was a reindeer clop\nJust a trick St. Nick, and I let the sucker in\n\nHe was rolly, he was poly, and I said, ""Holy moly!\nYou got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin""\nHe allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd\nOn the point of his jaw where the skin should\'ve been\nGets cool for a fool going out every Yule\nFor a day on a sleigh when the cold went low\nSo the beard may be weird but I\'ll never have it sheared\n\'Cause it\'s warm in the storm when it\'s ten below\nI said, ""You\'re right, it\'s cold tonight\nBut can you stop for a drop before you go?""\nHe said, ""Why not if the music\'s hot?\nAnd I\'ll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe""\nSo he went downstairs and forgot his cares\nAnd he rocked the spot and danced like a pro\nAnd every young girl tried to rock his world\nBut he boogie oogie oogied \'til he had to go\n\nAnd before he went, this fine old gent\nBrought a gift with a sift through his big red bags\nIn the top or the bottom, he reached in and got \'em\nToys for the boys, for the girls glad rags\nAnd the grownups got some presents too\nA new TV and a stereo\nA new Seville \'bout as blue as the sky\nThe best that money couldn\'t buy\n\'Cause money could never ever buy the feeling\nThe one that comes from not concealing\nThe way you you feel about your friends\nAnd this is how the story ends\n\nThe dude in red\'s back at the Pole\nUp north where everything is cold\nBut if he were right here tonight\nHe\'d say, Merry Christmas and to all a good night11Embed', 'If I Ruled The World Lyrics[Hook]\nIf I ruled the world\nI\'d love all the girls\nWear diamonds

President\nI\'m just here, to tell the world, how my story went\nYou see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome\nAnd then I moved to London, bought a brand new home\nAnd everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention\nLike a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions\nIt took a few years \'fore the day had come\nBut I was ruler of the world ranked #1\nSo I headed towards Washington to claim the crown\nLet the whole world know that the King was in town\nAs I arrived the crowd started to cheer\nAnd then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""\nSo I headed toward stage to make a

for stopping this show\nI just had to thank you all, huh, and me so\nMy first day in office, the King on the throne\nI spent my first three hours on the telephone\nYou know with newsmen reporters, and voters too\nI had so many calls, I didn\'t know what to do\nYou know hours passed I continued to work\nI signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt\nThen I shook off the pain, say this ain\'t no thing\n\'Cause there\'s nothing in the world like being #1 king!\n[Hook]\nIf I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)\nI\'d love all the girls  (I\'d love em love em baby!)\nWear diamonds and

wrong\nAnd I\'ma rock it to you baby baby all night long\nAnd it\'s a song about love and happiness\nIn a world of peace and you know that\'s fresh\nNow I\'m the king and I want you to know\nThat I\'m the Master Blaster Rapper who\'s running the show\nAnd to all of you rappers in every country\nYou better stop what you\'re doing and listen to me\n\'Cause we gotta stop war and use unity\nTo fight crime and hunger and poverty\n\'Cause the African baby is dying overseas\nWhile you sucker mission politicians busting out Z\'s\nHuh, 20 million people all unemployed\nWhile the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd\nWhile the working class just struggles hard\nTry to make ends meet against all odds\nWhile the poor man can\'t even deal with life\nYou know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe\nAnd it\'s time for a CHANGE, to a better way\n\'Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day\nSo LISTEN UP world while I teach this class\nAnd take heed to the message or we ain\'t gonna last\n\'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution\nOf woman and man to just join the revolution\nThat\'ll take your brain to a higher plane\nAnd help you deal in a world that\'s gone insane\nWith the problems that I know we can stop\nFrom the ruler of the world and the man on top\nBut the years went by, and time was up\nAnd then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck\nAnd all the people at the time who said they were my friends\nDidn\'t know me when my job had come to an end\nThe King who took my place was happy as can be\nHe was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali\nSo I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door\nOn my way to the ghetto to treat once more\n[Hook]\nIf I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)\nI\'d love all the girls  (I\'d love em love em

wiggle-double-wiggle in your behind\nTwice as nice, I'm skatin' on ice\nWhen my mama gave birth, she named me the baddest\nMC on Earth, y'all\nTo the beat that makes you freak\nGet out of your seat and freak to the beat\nThe weather is cold, so catch some heat1Embed"", '8 Million Stories Lyrics[Intro]\nThere are 8 million stories in the naked city\n\n8 million stories\n8 million stories (Cold-hearted city)\n8 million stories (Watch your back)\n8 million stories\n\n[Verse 1: Kurtis Blow]\nThere are 8 million stories in the naked city\nSome ice cold and told without pity\nAbout the mean streets and the ghetto culture\nThe pimps, the pushers, the sharks and vultures\nThings that happen when it reaches dark\nAnd all the things you hear about Central Park\nYou got to be down, you got to have strength\nIf you\'re gonna survive past 110th\nWell it ain\'t no thing when blood is spilled\nThe emergency ward is capacity filled\nAnd nothing ever comes as a big surprise\nAnd the naked city never closes its eyes\nA new story every day\nTold a thousand different ways\nThat\'s how it is and that\'s how it goes\nThe city with the 8 and six big O\'s\nNew York is a crazy city man\nWord, skyscrapers, everything\nAnd you just never know who you might be meeting in this town\nYo, my home boys Run DMC\nWhassup, man?\n\nYeah, man, it\'s called \'Eight Million Stories\'\nYo, i need some help, man, why don\'t you help me rhyme?\n\n[Verse 2: Run]\nA young girl seemed to be gaining weight\nHer parents all thought it was the food she ate\nTheir attitudes were all ""La Di Da Di""\nBut little did they know there\'s a baby in the body\nShe tried to hide it, but they\'ll soon know\nBecause sooner or later that baby\'s got to show\nCan her daddy just accept it as a fact\nThat it wasn\'t the meals and it wasn\'t the snack\n\n[Verse 3: DMC]\nThen there\'s another girl, her name is Vicki\nThe girl is fine, but sho\'nuff tricky\nVicki\'s fine, but then she\'s not very kind\nShe\'ll lay you down and then she\'ll rob you blind\nYou wake up in the morning and you\'re feeling blue\nBecause Vicki is gone and your money is too\nShe\'s more sinister than Peter Lorre\nAnd

complete\nBorn on a dim lit ghetto street\nFather unknown, mother astray\nHe learned about life the real hard way\nWearing pretty things for all the ladies to see\nFunky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry\nSpent all his time just counting his bank\nBecause he\'s a fly muh-ha-ha, now fill in the blank\nBecause he\'s a fresh kid and his money\'s long\nBeen the subject of a ghetto song\nPoor kids admire, ladies desire\nThey say water can\'t put out this fire\nBecause he\'s a fresh kid, yeah he\'s alright\nGrew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night\nAnd you could measure or even treasure\nThe thought that cocaine became his pleasure\nPeruvian rock never cut with speed\nAnd he gets skied until his nose would bleed\nAnd that was just one weakness, must admit\nThat when he took a hit he could never quit\nBecause he\'s one slick pusher living day by day\nWhen the crazy thing happened along the way\nYou know he started to base at a hell a pace\nAnd now it\'s a disgrace, he\'s got the pipe in his face\nFor twenty-four seven a terrible Jones\nDidn\'t take care of business, didn\'t answer the phone\nHe stayed home alone all in the twilight zone\nJust biting on a pipe like a dog on a bone\nTurning blue in the face, by just holding his breath\nWith the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest\nBut then he tried to stop, but it never worked\nAnd then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk\nJust to break it all down, you know he\'s not so slick\nBecause he spent all his money and he spent it real quick\nHe lost his car, his house, his friends, his wife\nAnd basing cocaine made him lose his life\nBecause he bought some on credit and couldn\'t pay\nAnd then the pusher looked for him and blew him away\nIn a blaze of glory in his own territory\n8 million sad but all real stories\n8 million stories\n8 million stories\n8 million stories (You hear what i\'m saying)\n8 million stories (Homeboys and girlies)\n8 million stories\n8 million stories (Sing)\n8

wasn\'t freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped\nI\'m trippin\' cause my winter coat got lost buttons and zippers that wouldn\'t stay zipped\nI never remembered a dinner, the brother was straight fat, cat\nNot even a Big Mac, black, I had Kit-Kat\'s on top of Cracker Jack\'s\nWalkin\' the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet\nAnd the freaks wouldn\'t speak, I never had lipstick on my

to admit that I used to draw\nPortraiture and the human form\nDoodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing\nMovin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond\nEven if it went beautifully wrong\nIt was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong\nNo name nuisance, stews in a bedroom\nOozing a brand-new cuneiform\nBarely commune with the horde\nGot a whole grayscale ungluing his world\nMight zone out to the yap of the magpie\nUnseen hand dragging his graphite\nCross contour, little bit of backlight\nBlack ink after a Bristol to baptize\nYou can't imagine the rush that ensue\nWhen you get three dimensions stuffed into two\nThen it's off to a school where it's all that you do\nBeing trained and observed by a capable few\nBack in New York, five peeps and a dog\nIn a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs\nPlus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod\nDistractions free to maraud\nI left some years a deer in the light\nI left some will to spirit away\nI let my fears materialize\nI let my skills deteriorate\nHaunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing\nA mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity\nIn rickety condition with an ID crisis\nNap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…\n[Hook]\nShapes falling out of the fringe\nAll heart, though we would've made cowardly kings\nThey will chop you down just to count your rings\nJust to count your rings, just to count your rings\nAnd there were colors pouring out of the fringe\nAll heart, though we would've made cowardly kings\nThey will chop you down just to count your rings\nJust to count your rings, just to count your rings\n[Verse 2]\nUsed to paint\nHard to admit that I used to paint\nNatural light on a human face\nStenciled fire on his roommate's bass\nIt was blooming addiction\nAmiss in the pushing of pigment\nBook like a tattooed pigskin, look\nPinhead kids of the minute\nDrank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic\nAnd it grew up into linseed oil over linen\nJoy to the poison, voice of the resin\nCapture a map of the gesture\nBack up, add a little accurate fat to the figure\nRedo that, move that inward\nZinc white lightning shoots from his fingers\nStudio strewn with illusion and tinctures\nStay tuned for the spooky adventures\nYou can't imagine the stars that align\nWhen a forearm starts foreshortening right\nOr a torso hung on a warping spine\nIn proportion reads as warm and alive\nRoutine day with a dirt cheap brush\nThen a week goes by and it goes untouched\nThen two, then three, then a month\nAnd the rest of your life, you beat yourself up\nI left some seasons eager to fall\nI left some work to bury alive\nI let my means of being dissolve\nI let my person curl up and die\nEating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety\nHas brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy\nAligning with the trials of the anti-Midas\nNap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…\n[Hook]\nShapes falling out of the fringe\nAll

block\nWho always took her milk money at the morning bus stop\nThere was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle\nShe always gave a wave and holler\nOn her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor\nAnd she drew\nMen, women, kids, sunsets, clouds\nAnd she drew\nSkyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns\nAlways said hello to passersby\nThey\'d ask her why she passed her time\nAttaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile\nNow all the other children living in or near her building\nRan around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants\nThey would say\n""Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump

suitable, and she liked it that way\nShe had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit\nThey would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose\nThey appreciated space and Rico was an artist too\nSo they\'d connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew (Look!)\nNow every month or so, she\'d get a knock upon the front door\nJust one of the neighbors\nActing nice although she was a strange girl, really\nSay, ""Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?""\nLucy would smile and say ""I\'m busy, thank you much""\nAnd they would make a weird face the second the door shut\nAnd run and tell

wit' that there\nGet on the dancefloor come on take a stand\nAll the girlies in the place wanna dance with you,my man\nGet on the floor and work it out if you can\nHere's my ulterior motive,I mean my game plan\nIt doesn't hurt to flirt,just go 'head and chase a skirt\nYou can't help it,it's your line of work\nTo get women on the floor\nIt's you they adore,you might as well\nGive'em what they came here for\n\nYou know what time it is (x8)\nHang on party people,'cause here we go\nWe're gonna cold take the party to another plateu\nBut in order for us to achieve a new height\nWe wanna hear Flash cut the beat up,ain't that right\nWhile Flash is choppin' the mix like an ax on the wood\n\n(scratch)\n\nYou gotta dance 'cause the beat is finger lickin' good\nThrow your hands above your head and reach for a cloud\nAnd if there's  anything you want to say,say it loud\nI know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim\nAnd ya'll are letting me know we're cold blowin' the rim\nThat's right,you're being served,served with a smile\nAnd homeboy you don't like it,we can step in the aisle\nJust show no shame,you know it's only night\nAnd if there's anything you want to get off,get it off tonight\n\nYou know what time it is (x4)\n\nA simple push of the fade,a little flex of the wrist\nFlash whoopin' the mix while I'm kickin' the gift\nYo' like a double edge razor,the boy is nice\nWhen he cuts,give him room,or you might get sliced\nHe's too cold to hold,too hot to be stopped\nThis jam that we got is good to the last drop\nWhether you like it or not,we rock\nYo' since the day we emerged,have you heard\nThat it was all about a party and yo this is word\nThis party's rated NS for no suckers allowed\nThat's the scoop\nHear me troop\nSo don't you come here actin' wild\nBut as you know there's always on in the crowd\nYou wanna party then act like you know,can you dig it\nAnd if you came too ill forget it,I ain't wit it\nYou know what time it is (x5)\n\nHornsEmbed"",

You are\nDivinity.  My primitive mind was struggling\nJust to understand the meaning of life, forgive me\nI never told my mommy, I couldn’t break her spirit.  She always\nWished her daughter extraordinary thinking, so I\nTraveled alone, young, sixteen, got in\nThe habit of not staying at home, doing the\nSad walk like Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty\nTrips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me\nI couldn’t eat shit.  I fainted frequent\nOn cold floors and I pause and I think, “Keep it”\nI’m lost.  My four friends know and just\nFuck at the boys’ apartments for rent, so I’m all\nWishing that it’s a dream ending soon.  I’ve actually\nErased a lot that I’ve been through\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nSee, when\nThe rain comes down\nI know it’s falling for me\nAnd only for me\nAnd when\nThe pain comes around, there’s nowhere\nElse I rather would be\nI know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)\n[Verse 2: Jean Grae]\nNow all my bitter homies saying, “That’s what men do.”  Feeling\nRetarded for seeing partner potential.  On top\nOf that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur.  I can’t\nTake it, I’m contemplating a Glock burner, a\nCop murderer.  I can’t leave.  This can’t be\nThe tears streaming, and I can’t see they lanced me\nAnd I’m passing out, and this is just for blood.  They had\nTo cover the mass amounts.  I’ve had enough\nAnd you don’t know what it’s like in waiting rooms, and out-\n-side, their picketing pictures could slay you\nThey’re screaming, “Victims,” and spitting ‘til they shame you\nI hold my head low and shiver, push my way through\nThey put you in a room where you can change into\nYour gown and shower cap, shaking as a fiend would do\nAnd that’s when you think of leaving, fleeing the building\nAnd then they call you and you’re hearing the call of your children\nThey count down from ten now.  You wanna stop ‘em, but\nYou say it in your head: you’re out for the cut\nAnd then you wake up in another room with plenty others\nThey call it recovery.  You’re thinking, “We ain’t mothers”\nAnd then prescription pills, written a ‘script with chills\nAn understatement.  You’re dressed but you’re naked still\nAnd your brain won’t think straight\nWait.  Can’t finish this\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nSee, when\nThe rain comes down\nI know it’s falling for me\nAnd only for me\nAnd when\nThe pain comes around, there’s nowhere\nElse I rather would be\nI know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)\n\n[Verse 3: Jean Grae]\nI kept it bottled up.  My parents found the pills\nScreaming, “God what have you done?”  Cried ‘til I snotted blood\nThen got a gun.  My temple ran quick though\nFrom the thought, then the worst: I was caught in the same place\nA year later.  For me, that’s when hatred started\nMy faith martyred.  I’ve dated the father of a father\nThen I moved on.  Years passed, the guilt’s\nWorse and it builds ‘til your heart’s smashed\nThen I miscarried.  Twenty-two age, I was headed to\nA breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down\nI was a failure at that too, bailed from\nThe rap then, but fate took me back in\n“Sing” is a tattoo my fingers attached with.  Twenty-seven\nWith three kids that I never met.  What if I\nWas Catholic?  Wonder if they hate me, thinking how\nTheir mother could ever murder?  Well take me, Hell\nTo the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly\nI am a monster, see.  How could I possibly\nCorrespond with God when I gave the authority\nTo end their life?\nBut it’s never over, even if we have a child\nThey could have had a brother or a sister or both\nI’m thinking about another life that almost got close\nPraying that, in another time, we could have changed posts\nIf I could just reverse time, I would\nI don’t know what I would do.

What might be obvious\nTo most, she says they’re too bitter, can’t see\nThe world the way she does, clean lungs, undamaged liver, sees\nThugs through her pink-tinted glasses.  Occasionally, weed\nDoes make her giggle, listen to some music closer, dudes\nApproach her lightly, wanna be her lover, and she obliges\nLikes to cuddle under the covers by candlelit fires\nOblivious to lying schemes to talk her out of clothes, says\nShe’s just in love with love, cuts her classes, spends too much time\nEntrancing, romancing.  Things are changing quickly.  She’s asking\n“Why aren’t you spending more time with me?” Nigga’s eyes are getting\nShifty, coming over later smelling of pussy on his face\nJeans and sweaters—something’s fishy.  And it’s not what\nHe tells her, man, it’s what he don’t, and she don’t understand\nAnd, for some years, she probably won’t.  Just wants an honest man\nFor goodness sake, they’re backstabbing and cutting her throat\nRestraining orders follow, but she still optimistic about it\nLike Annie, thinking “Tomorrow” maybe will be a better day\nI let her pray on bended knees, ask him to send Prince Charming, please\nShe’s never cheated, treats her man well, cooks, cleans\nDresses sexy for him, halter tops and tight jeans, would break\nThe law for him, go through a couple of these relationships\nStill stays strong, she’s too young and dumb to call it quits\nLearns that she carrying twice, scared and afraid the first\nTime.  The second, she don’t even cry.  He makes her wipe away\nHis tears and it hurts.  They always leave and turn crazy, so\nShe doesn’t flirt, spends time warning the babies\nGoes through a couple of these relationships and still stays strong\nToo young and dumb to call it quits.  It’s still a love song\n[Verse 2: Jean Grae]\nShe’s got\nA good man.  She’s nineteen, he’s twenty-one and sweet and honest\nPromised to love her, talk of marriage. She would never wanna\nBe somebody’s baby’s mother, use rubbers occasionally\nWhen she’s flowing, open off the affection and gifts and all\nThe good manners he’s showing.  He’s trying to build a life for himself\nStudies late, computer shit, and she’s missing attention that\nShe’s not getting, sex dwindles.  Crawling in the sheets, he say\nHe tired, and she say she feel neglect and defeat, just doesn’t\nSee his ambition, she wanna be the universe and hold\nHis center position, starts hanging ‘round the best friend more\nCrazy attraction, takes impulsive action, dropped the drawers\nAnd falls in love, the world explodes when she confesses.  “Yeah, I did it\nSo?”  They’re so tight, it’s like he moves when she stretches.  Over\nThe couple years, too many stresses, girls who wanna fight her\nBitches writing letters, friendships disappearing, plus\nHe rhymes, so it’s competitive pressure, miscarriage.  They break up\nFifty times a week and make up just as much.  He fucking\nAnd I know, but pretending I’m out of touch.  It’s getting\nStrained and gets physical, she cries until the river dries\nAnd leaves her dead and cold, packs up her things and leaves behind.  What I\nHad thought was gold was only gold-plated.  Thinking of all\nThe other ones I could have just left and up and dated\nSingle after four years.

Let’s go\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm feeling numb, thinking of changing my name to Crystal Meth\nI’m playing this game, holding my mic like a pistol\nAiming at death and I love nobody\nAlone in this world—that's how I came in it\nBut shit could flash and reverse the same in a minute\nI don't even love life no more—my niggas, I just live it\nAnd I don't love love.  All the hurting is infinite\nI cry myself to sleep sometimes, wept a gallon of tears\nFrom malice, divorced mates to lost peers\nDrowned it in a haze of smoke and glasses that never ran empty\nBottles of So-Co, cheap vodka and 20/20\nSpending my pennies for thoughts on quarts of Henny\nFame?  Got none.  Pain?  Like the movie, have plenty\nLike a shotgun, double-barrel fully loaded, ready to blow\nI want to turn around and aim at myself\nBeen failing my health.  I hardly even eat no more\nMy lunch is munchies from the corner store, tropical fantasy\nMe and my family, me and my niggas used to be tight\nBut now we see each other on the block with no pounds\nAnd keep it moving.  Gotta move on\nI know I’m doing it right.  I’m still living, hustling life\nStill, shit\n[Hook]\nFor all my niggas, smoke a pack a day\nFor all my niggas, hold a bottle, drink the pain away\nWhat type of life is this?\nFor all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave\nLet’s keep living\nFor all my niggas, drink the pain away\nFor all my niggas, smoke a pack of Newports a day\nWhat type of life is this?\nFor all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave\nLet’s keep living.

Every step is play-by-play\nHand to mouth.  I'm just trying to make the moments count\nEyes read, stressing my soul.  Chest grows\nFrom heavy smoking addict since nine.  A nicotine addict\nDevoted at it but, still, I need some type of release\nI quit the trees at least\nYo, I'm learning, niggas, but I'm slow at it\nAlways gave my motherfuckers the benefit of the doubt\nBut it seems that everybody’s just out for self\nI used to love her.

I’ll work my way up from the bottom\nTo the top of the ladder, claim what's rightfully mine\nI’m working against time.  It's been too long\nAnd I haven't even had a chance to leave y'all yet.

can\'t touch me with a ten-foot pole\nAnd I even made the devil sell me his soul\nNow we crash through walls, cut through floors\nBust through ceilings and knock down doors\nAnd when we\'re on the tape, we\'re fresh out the box\nYou can hear our sound for blocks and blocks\nFor every living person we\'re a verbal treat\nIt\'s me and DMC, Jay where\'s the beat?\n\nNow we\'re the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool\nI\'m DMC, I rock and roll, I\'m DJ Run, I rock and rule\nIt\'s not a Trick or Treat and it\'s not a April Fool\nIt\'s all brand new, never ever old school\n\nYou got the music in your body and you can\'t comprehend\nWhen your mind won\'t wiggle and your knees won\'t bend\nMusic ain\'t nothin but a people\'s jam\nIt\'s DJ Run, DMC, rockin without a band\nNow I walked on ice and never fell\nI spent my time in a plush hotel\nI stood on many stages, held many mics\nTake airplane flights, at huge heights\nSo all you sucker MCs, you gotta say please\n\'Cause when he jumps high, I\'m pulling down ree\'s\nGot a song so strong, it\'s knocking down trees\nIs it hard to believe it\'s Run-D.M.C.\'s?\nI am from, around the way\nAnd Run goes to school, every day\nAnd Jay plays the records he has to play\nAnd we get down with no delay, HEY!\nI rock the party with the words I speak\nAnd Run says the rhymes that are unique\nAnd Jay cuts the records every day of the week\nAnd we are the crew that can never be meek\nSo don\'t try to diss me, try to be my friend\n\'Cause if you do, you\'ll get yours in the end\nThe rhymes we say shall set a trend\nBecause a devastating rap is what we send\n\nEvery jam we play, we break two needles\nThere\'s three of us but we\'re not the Beatles\nMy name is Darryl, you can call him D\nYou can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC\nPeople always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""\nD\'s for never dirty, MC for mostly clean\n\nLike we said before, we rock hardcore\nI\'m DJ Run, I can scratch, I\'m DMC, I can draw\nAnd now we got the knack  to attract\nOur rhyme\'s an aphrodisiac\nWe\'ll reign on your brain and rock your knot\nWhen it comes to rock, give it all we got\nTo be MCs, we got what it takes\nLet

Since I freestyle\nGenesis been Biblical—that’s something you got to give in to\n\n[Verse 1: Chino XL]\nSince born in my mama vaginal sauna\nAs a sonogram, I been fond of phonics\nIt’s ironic.  Even as an embryonic\nFed through an umbilical—don’t that sound biblical?\nI’ve been a terror since I teareth out of that uterus\nEvil plans were made to defeat us as a fetus\nThough now I walk in infamy, as a child, they had it in for me\nWas raised with guns and infantry in diapers at an infancy\nThe childhood of a hood that was raised in the hood: cops said\n“Put your hands in the hot sky,” threw my hands down on the hot hood\nCan’t whine or drink wine—nine planets planned it\n‘Til it became apparent my parents shouldn’t have been a parent\nState to state, we ran some.  I wasn’t worth no ransom\nMoney, won’t you hand some?  A nigga wasn’t handsome\nRaised the mind like Charles Manson’s.  Knew I was some man’s son\nBut which one?  That made me strong, created my poison tongue\n[Hook: Chino XL]\nPerfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes\nBack in the 1800s, I was burned at the stake (I am the Wordsmith)\nMetaphor Mephistopheles, degrees I’ve achieved, the brain\nFluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas (I am the Wordsmith)\nI could reveal the true name of God, you’d go insane upon\nHearing it, release enough winds to blow down pyramids (I am the Wordsmith)\nI’m the Michelangelo of syllables.  Since I freestyle\nGenesis been Biblical—that’s something you got to give in to\n\n[Verse 2: Chino XL]\nWhile you cut school ‘cause you ain’t feel too good\nI cut school ‘cause my cuts ain’t heal too good\nThrough all the physical abuse, my mind escaped through the gift\nOf wordplay, I memorized encyclopedias and dictionaries.  I wrote\nAnthems from antonyms, harmonies from homonyms\nCreated cinema from synonyms, livid to eliminate that\nIllustrious life you’re living in, wrote rhetoricals in rhythms, I could\nParalyze with a parable, make rhymes out of religion\nCrucify you with a prefix or suffocate you with a suffix\nWrote lectures so infectious, it’s known to infect the listeners\nWho dissing us?  Yo, punks, you wait.  I punctuate\nMy karma’s the comma that put you inside of a coma\nHyphen, dot, dot, semicolon, leave you semi-swollen\nQuestion mark, you pregnant?  Oh, you’re not.  I love you, period\nTo sum it up, language is my essence.  Fucked up\nIn all my adolescence ‘til my moms was out of lessons\nLaws, I store convenient.  Still, I robbed the convenience store\nLove Mom/fuck Mom—shit, I ain’t love me no more\nMentally, it didn’t register, bitch!  Empty the register, bitch!\nYou’re just a cashier, bitch!  Give the cash here!\nI’ll shoot you in your cabbage, hijack a getaway cab, bitch\nWords ain’t making me no loot, don’t change no Dow Jones average\nRegardless, we’re Godless.  They stole my innocence in a sense\nThe judge sentenced me to three lifetimes sentences\nTo write my life and times in sentences, art my dark arch\nNemesis.  They want me off the premises—that’s what the premise is\nLocked on a tier where you can’t shed a tear at\nStudied more Shakespeare than any African shakes his spear at\nAnd the whole world fear that (Uh huh), and it hurts.  I got\nCaught killing time, but then I got away with words\n[Hook: Chino XL]\nPerfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes\nBack in the 1800s, I was burned at the stake (I am the Wordsmith)\nMetaphor Mephistopheles, degrees I’ve achieved, the brain\nFluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas (I am the Wordsmith)\nI could reveal the true name of God, you’d go insane upon\nHearing it, release enough winds to blow down pyramids (I am the Wordsmith)\nI’m the Michelangelo of syllables.  Since I freestyle\nGenesis been Biblical—that’s something you got to give in to\n\n[Bridge: Chino XL]\nPeople can say whatever they want about me, but agree\nThat I am the Wordsmith (I am the Wordsmith)\nThey can try to ignore everything that I’ve achieved, but agree\nThat I am the Wordsmith (I am the Wordsmith).  Yo\nThe love of words is deep in my veins, helps me\nTo silence my pain.  I am the Wordsmith (Oh, I am the Wordsmith)\nEven if never move a million units, it’s my blessing\nHow I do it.  I’m the Wordsmith (I am the Wordsmith)\n\n[Verse 3: Chino XL]\nI’m in\nA game full of morons (True) and they keep putting more on (True)\nI tutor the Tora, I'm in the core of the Quran\nThe mind’s what I represent, and emcees better re-present\nI’m taking this rapping bullshit to the fullest extent\nI have reservations why Indians are on reservations\nTold the board of education I was bored of education\nAs far as this go, I leave you deader than disco\nRocking sex and violence over sax and violins\nThrough your mind’s camera lens, you’re in need of an ambulance\nI’ll knock you to the asphalt—it’s your own ass’ fault\nYour last thought: I’ll never sell myself short to be famous\nAnd taking it up the anus just ain’t us\nThe world could get the penis of this classical-trained pianist\nMy P.O. was p.o.’d, handed me a cup, told me to pee in this\nThe linguist musician, my college position’s my intuition\nTold me I wouldn’t be affording tuition\nMy education’s all on my own, so I might have been\nBorn yesterday, but I rhyme like there’s no tomorrow\n[Hook: Chino XL]\nPerfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes\nBack in the 1800s, I was burned at the stake (I am the Wordsmith)\nMetaphor Mephistopheles, degrees I’ve achieved, the brain\nFluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas (I am the Wordsmith)\nI could reveal the true name of God, you’d go insane upon\nHearing it, release enough winds to blow down pyramids (I am the Wordsmith)\nI’m the Michelangelo of syllables.

sold\nYour plaques corrode when I collage colloquials\nAt first the buzz was local but now the nose grows like Pinocchio\nNo lie, no T-H-C, T-H-E, T-H-O-U-G-H-T makes me high in intelligence quotient\nI drop fax like Hitachi, exfoliate rap and come cleaner than Jeru's enema\nOnce the secret within my esophagus is discovered like Tutankhamun's sarcophagus\nI got niggas looking for Webster's like George Papadopolous\n[Chino XL]\nYo Ras pardon me my unfamiliar soliloquies, similes\nSimilar to Reginald Denny's, facial injuries\nYou couldn't locate my transient thoughts with lo-jack\nMolest your mind like Oprah Winfrey's behind when she was a small child\nPunchlines with more elasticity than Biggie's stretch marks\nChino X sparks, mad urban\nI ain't scared to put the things that going around me on tape like Mark Fuhrman\nSexing picture perfect hoes like Pocahontas often\nAnd I'd rather hear Willie Nelson than fucking Montell Jordan\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro:

Holding my child\nShe’s 10 months old, the hospital was so cold\nDefinitely ruining all of holiday plans of beach sands\nFilling out some bland paperwork with shaky hands (Lost)\nSeeing little children stricken with a certain sickness\nClutch my baby a little tighter, reflect the nervous feelings\nA whole hour passed, we starting to lose patience\nHumbled by the thoughts of patients lost in this situation (What’s going on?)\nHere comes a nurse, not knowing that we should fear the worst\nSee the doctor’s mouth moving, couldn’t even hear the words\nThis isn’t happening to you, I’m like Superman\nAnd I could protect you from anything, I was really scared (Serious)\nI realized what I heard, but not prepared for\nThe sentence that the doctor said, “Your daughter has cancer”\n[Hook: Chino XL]\nI will take my life right now\nIf you would save my child\nI’ll exchange my life for hers\nThis is my solemn vow\nNo more chemo in her veins\nAnd no more screams of pain (I pray)\nThis is a father’s shame\nThat I can’t save you from everything\n\n[Verse 2: Chino XL]\nOkay, I gotta man up\nIt hit me so hard that I could barely stand up (My world stopped)\nThen the flowers and balloons and the cards came\nPrayers many hours, knees bruised all in God’s name (Hurt so much)\nIf only my feeble hands could remove\nThis neuroblastoma tumor from your adrenal glands (Helpless)\nWhy you?  Why now?  It didn’t feel fair\nYour grandma shed tears, you lost your hair\nIt’s unbelievable little Bella was that strong\nAnd inconceivable we lived in the hospital that long (Forever)\nProtecting your immune system from contaminants\nYou had to wear a medical mask, can’t give my kid a kiss (Imagine)\nI learned to envision your face growing, getting older\nEnvisioned you driving your first car and getting your diploma\nEnvisioned your wedding, your husband better be a soldier\nA little girl sick like you died two rooms over (Eva)\n[Hook: Chino XL]\nI will take my life right now\nIf you would save my child\nI’ll exchange my life for hers\nThis is my solemn vow\nNo more chemo in her veins\nAnd no more screams of pain (I pray)\nThis is a father’s shame\nThat I can’t save you from everything\n\n[Verse 3: Chino XL]\nChemotherapy made Christmas hard to process\nI fed the family faith, hoping it’d make their fears starve to death\nYour momma’s tough, prayed to Saint Jude’s that it’s a bad dream\nBut couldn’t be.  I’m speaking to doctor and not Epstein (Reality)\nI remember the cries, remember the meals fed through tubes\nPulling the red wagon, the sound of the plastic wheels\nKind of a metaphor for pulling through this ordeal.  I pray\nMy enemies never even have to know how this feels (It hurts)\nBut forget our feelings.  Doesn’t matter.  You’re the one suffering\nYou couldn’t speak a lot yet, but it’s like your eyes was saying\n“Daddy, if it’s an obstacle and price I got to pay\nFor a long, great life, then we’ll make it through okay.”  The day\nOf your final surgery, I still live in that moment\nThe teddy bear you were holding, I still own it\nI watched the doors closing, February 2, 2004\nMy little girl is cured\n[Interlude: Voicemail from Daughter]\n“Hi, daddy!

tirelessly to bring me down as a man\nI let you into my life whore but now that door is slammed\nIt's 3am, my headlight's off, I put my gun on the dash\nOur love and hate line's become thinner than Ginuwine's mustache\nFinding myself addicted to the drama\nLike if a woman don't give me no problem then I don't seem to want her\nI gotta break the cycle of being psycho\nA mean title deservedly unnervingly not being effected by you\nAt your pokes pins, character assassinations and prostitute friends\nI want to shoot you in your fucking limbs\nKick 'em with my Camel Timbs until them bitches hemorrhaging\nAnger every half an hour out of 24 I'm averaging\nThe arrogance, you thinking that I will never fucking leave\n'Cause I reward you for all this bad behavior like if you my seed\nBut I see now this isn't necessarily meant to be\nSincerely I'm unhappy living in misery, come rescue me\nI've created my own prison from bad decision\nOne finger pointed at you is three pointed at me, see I'm the victim\nWas with you instead of my daughters like every weekend\nYou're mad I wouldn't bow down like Japanese people greeting\nWe was the finest Rican couple in Jimmy's café\nWho would be

tears\nI went through something with momma, no drama\nSomething that came and went, real life karma\nMy pop think his son is deserting him, its hurtin him\nGuess I gotta be the man, sit down and work with him\nMy little boy 7, he the sequel to the thug\nSo I told him the money will never equal the love\nListen I'm grown y'all\nWhen it comes to my family it ain't never a problem, it's only a phone call\nThey tend to take that and run with it\nSo every other month I be on some new phone, new number shit\nThey violated Stay again\nGus totaled the Beamer and broke Kay leg again\nShhh, let us pray again\nAnd I ain't get enough of hanging in the local bars yet\nHad to let the thing off, 'cross town in the projects\nAll these rumors and shit, I ain't get robbed yet\nBitch ass niggas ain't stop acting like broads yet\nIn arm reach off a gun and a mask\nSomebody clipped me for a hundred in cash\nStill feel me, I hit the road try to get more grip\nIt was cool 'til a muh'fucking tour bus flipped\nUh, no charges brought up, bitch popped up with a kid\nGot caught up, then I put a court up\nNow the road to the riches is taking me longer\nIt ain't kill yet so it making me stronger\nI don't know if its the hate, frustration, or hunger\nThat keep a nigga going, rapping for a reason\nShit don't just don't happen, shit happens for a reason\nI'm that dude, like it or love it\nI do my thing in the hood, and get right with a budget\nAin't afraid to give my life to the public\nAnd when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss\nHow my 16's give you a visual\nI know you thinking he ain't really selling, how he live off residuals\nBut right now the game is pitiful\nNiggas is lonely, they need company 'cause they miserable\nYeah, uh-huh shit it still real B\nThat's why

day that we first met\nI wasn't even feeling you then, but worse yet\nI was all up in the mix with one of your friends\nAnd when you seen us you would always give me one of your grins\nLike if I only knew what I was missing\nI would quit kissing on this chick and change my position\nI really thought you and my man was a better match\nI never thought you was the type that I could catch\nI used to see you out in the park with different cats\nThem Big Willie types that rocked them pimp hats\nHad every other guy on the block trying to get you\nWishing that they had that rap to get with you\nFelt you was out of my league\nIt's like if you was silk and linen, then I was fatigue\nI never would have pictured you and me together\nBut it's like the way I hold you we was meant to be together, come

could\nTo stop us from being together, it's all good\nThey was mad 'cause I got you and they didn't\nSome even tried to approach me, I'm not kidding\nHad to be ten times I got into a fight\nWith niggas tryin' to say I wasn't hitting it right\nYup, they kept on hating, just kept on waiting\nHoping that we'd break up but we kept dating\nNever knew it'd be so hard to be with you\nI should make it easy on myself and just quit you\n(Make it easy on yourself) I need to make it easy on myself\nYup, I need to make it easy on myself\n(Make it easy on yourself) Yup, I need to make it easy on myself\nYup, and just leave you alone (No, wait)\nNo, wait, when I hold you, it feels so great\nI realize and recognize that you my soulmate\nIt's us forever, had to let you know\nJust like I told

snitching to the Jake\nIs the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake\nBut the problem we face seems so great\nThat we can\'t escape so we accept our fate\nSo the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint\nIf an artist is a part of a community\nAnd got an opportunity to get that cake\nWould never come back to the hood, no immunity\nUsually a nigga like that so fake,no different from a snake\nNothing left to give cause you always wanna take\nIf you ain\'t using all the talents God provided you with\nFor the betterment of man, understand you ain\'t nothing but a waste\nLook into the face of a young girl\nRaising up like a flag when it\'s unfurled\nGot game listening to her mother\'s pearls\nAnd she love Beyonce cause she run the world\nHer mama used to run this city\nWay back before the nigga Puff was Diddy\nWhen it came to the music then she got real picky\nFrom New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie\nNo disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge\nAnd she felt that Pac was more lyrical\nPlus she never went to college\nBut she called herself \'Earth\' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual\nShe God in the physical\nAnd it\'s only natural to pray for a little you\nMusical so she played the umbilical chords\nSo her daughter was born it was a miracle\nMusic is the light when it\'s dark\nAnd the way that you spit your dart is a big part\nShe grew up loving hip hop\nNow all her daughter got is ""Love & Hip Hop""\nNowadays niggas turn up for the sex\nNiggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement\nRatchet

inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment\nHer body is politics\nLost count of how many whores she was called today\nShe won\'t do it no more, lost all her faith\nThey say she exaggerate

all kind of rap groups before sampling loops\nRappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits\nMe and Kenny couldn\'t afford that\nSo we would go to the park when they was jammin\' to hear rap\nI used to listen till the cops broke it up\nI always thought to myself ""Damn, why they fucked it up?""\nBut nevertheless I was in love with the microphone\nAnd it stayed that way until I left home\nOn the streets of New York, now I\'m free\nBut with freedom comes big responsibility\nI used to walk around driven by the force\nI remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off\nI used to wonder about crews that used to rock\nThey were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top\n[Bridge: KRS-ONE]\nDo you ever think about when you outta here?\nRecord deal and video outta here?\nMercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here?\nNo doubt BDP is old school, but we ain\'t goin\' out!\n\n[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]\nAfter livin\' on the streets alone\nSome years went by, I signed myself into a group home\nI used to

it had to be a better way, see\nSo I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC\nAround 1984 I left the group home, again alone\nStill dreamin\' about the microphone\nGimme a chance man, I know I can rock it\nBut I had to worry about puttin\' money in my pocket\nSo when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock\nAnd we both loved hip-hop\nI was takin\' suckas out in the shelter

hang with Ced Gee\nAnd DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric B\nI didn\'t meet Rakim till later with Scott\nI remember we were jammin\' at the rooftop\nIt used to irk me when these critics had opinions\nScott would say ""Just keep rappin\', I\'ll keep spinnin\'""\nWe had a fucked up contract, but we signed it\nAnd dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded\nWe told the critics your opinions are bull\nSame time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full\nHip-hop pioneers we didn\'t ask to be\nBut right then hip-hop changed drastically\nPeople didn\'t wanna hear the old rap sound\nWe started

About they programs?\nYou still watching Lindsay, you don't see that low hand?\nLet go, man, the flood is coming\nDon't be scared, get prepared, keep your motor running\nRock with me\n[Hook]\nHigher level\n\n[Verse 2]\nYep, it's all mass control, here's the philosophy\nCortés knew about the Aztec prophecy\nBefore he invaded their society\nHe studied their cultural psychology\nHe knew they had armor, guns, and steeds\nSo he arrived in the Aztec year 1-Reed\nThat's the year Quetzalcoatl\nWas prophecized to return from exile in fact\nCortés played out the Aztec myth\nAnd took away those people's will to resist\nCortés played on religious beliefs\nAnd blinded the Aztecs, cause he was a thief\nLook, the Yucatan, that's a Mayan book of cycles\nIt lets the Mayans know when the Gods are gonna strike you\nIn fact, every 13 K'atuns you see\nThe Mayans were visited with a catastrophe\nSo every 200 and 56 or 7 years\nThe Mayan people lived with this fear\nSo on the island of Tayasal now Flores\nThe Spanish came armed with this knowledge\nThey knew according to the Mayan heavens\nThat the next cycle was 1697\nSo as the Mayans stood there fixed on the heavens\nThe Spanish showed up with all of their weapons\nMarch 13th, 1697\nThe Mayan people learned a terrible lesson\nYour fears and tears are used against you\nCause 80% of world control is mental\nBut back to the Mayans, they getting some more\n257 years after Tayasal\nA US-backed coup overthrows their democracy in 1954\nThat's exactly 257 years from when the Spaniards arrived at their shores\nI'm getting to the core of the lesson\nLets see what happens in 2211\nThat's the next cycle, that people remember\nLike 2012, the 21st of December\nThe consciousness may shift, you may turn the light\nBut you are the universe, you're gonna be alright\nThe pole may shift, your soul may lift\nTo higher consciousness but you know all this\nThe Edutainment style will persist\nForget the fear, it's knowledge that runs all this\n[Hook]2Embed"", 'Black Cop Lyrics[Intro]\nBuck buck buck-buck-buck, buck-buck buck buck!\nAll rude bwoy lissen up!\n\n[Verse 1]\nBlack cop!!

get up and dance 'cause Kane said so\nIf you were lounging around it's time to get up\nPardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up\nI appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer\nThat would dare to compare, I do declare\nGetting busy is where it's at\nBut what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that\n'Cause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light\nBut I drop bass just like Barry White\nSo how could you think that you pose a threat?\nYou say you're rocking, how many shows you get?\nAll your vocals go local on the M-I-C\nMines go a great distance, like AT&T\nI'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this\nFuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this\nSo, yo, go for what you know\nAttempt to debate so I can humiliate\nWe can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse\nGet you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse\nTo take you to your burial ground\nBecause the Big Daddy Kane always throws down\nCorrect, I get respect, I'm out to collect\nCash money, cause I get raw\n[Break]\nEverybody get up!\nEverybody get up!\nEverybody get up!\nEverybody get up!\nBoy do I hate a...\nI'm coming!\nI'm

ease\n'Cause I'm at my apex and others are below\nNothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo\nSecond to none, making MC's run\nSo don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one\nI relieve rappers just like Tylenol\nAnd they know it, so I don't see why you all\nTry to front, perpetrating a stunt\nWhen you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt\nI'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi\nTo stage a rage is what rap did to me\nTo make me want to create chaos and mayhem\nCold rock a party until the A.M\nI'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle\nWhile you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a\nLittle rhyme with authority, superiority\nAnd captivate the whole crowd's majority\nThe rhymes I use definitely amuse\nBetter than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues\nI'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw\n'Cause I get raw\n[Break]\nEverybody get up!\nEverybody get up!\nEverybody get up!\nEverybody get up!\nEverybody get up!\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive a speech like a reverend, rappers start severing\nAnd

boy, you don't deserve this\nI work like a slave to become a master\nAnd when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to\nBe perfectly fitted, 'cause I'm committed\nThe entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it\nI go and flow and grow to let you know\nI damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro-\n-fessional unquestionable without doubt superb\nSo full of action, my name should be a verb\nMy voice will float on every note\nWhen I clear my throat, that's all she wrote!\nThe minute that the Kane starts to go on\nBelieve it's gonna be smooth sailing so on\nAs I put other rappers out of their misery\nGet them in a battle and make them all history\nRuling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling\nWatch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling\nOn my throne, with a bronze microphone\nHmm, God bless the child that can hold his own\n'Cause I get raw\n[Break]\nAin't it good to you?\nAin't it good to you?\nAin't it good to you?\nHere's an experiment to begin with...\n\n[Verse 4]\nTwenty-four sev chilling, killing like a villain\nThe meaning of raw is Ready And Willing\nTo do whatever is clever, take a loss, never\nAnd the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must\nAnd I come off hard with rhymes that are odd\nI rip the microphone and leave it scarred\nNever smoking or hitting or taking a sniff\nOnly crushing MC's that be trying to riff\nI get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic\nMake MC's panic, they all get frantic\nAnd skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive\nAs I rock but hey, what you expected?\nI'll get raw for you just like a warrior\nRapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I\nEver let a Fisher-Price MC hang\nTheir rhymes are toy, nothing but yin-yang\nSo if we battle on the microphone\nBring your own casket and tombstone\nAnd I'mma preach your

time even though that\'s a lie\nAnd if you want my love, I give you all that I got\nFrom the bottom to the top and I won\'t get far\nBut just make sweet love \'til the sound is stopped\nIt\'s like an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\nYou can\'t get the feeling unless I\'m here with you\nIt takes two to tango and to make love too\nAnd when it comes to that, I\'m thinking of you\nWith your fine, silky body and your pearly white teeth\nAnd when I see you, baby, oh, what a relief\nFrom the girls I\'ve seen that end of a sore\nBut now I\'m with the one and only girl that I adore\nWith your pretty clear skin and your light brown eyes\nAnd your big derriere and your nice brown thighs\nSo, be very clever and stay mine forever\n\'Cause I\'d hate to lose you, baby, \'cause you\'re soft as a feather\nSo, don\'t make me beg you on my knee\nJust stay my main girl for a century\nI don\'t think I\'m bad, don\'t box or know karate\nI\'m just an MC to keep the boogie in the party\nWith you people on the floor\nGive you what you\'re bargaining for\nMake you all wanna dance until you can\'t no more\nNot a player, but a lover, like though I wrote\nAnd when it comes to the mic, I take complete control\nI never imitate, but I will appreciate\n\'Cause everything I do, you know it gotta be great\nSo, if you want to, party people, come on, no need to stall\nAnd if you wanna boogie, we can all have a ball\nPeople used to call me MC Spoony Spoon\nBut when I came to rock I didn\'t come too soon\nOne day a pretty lady came over to me\nAnd said ""Why don\'t you change your name\nTo MC Spoonie Gee?""\nThen I looked at her when I was in commission\nAnd said that I\'m the Metropolitician\nAnd I rock a big crowd, no trouble at all\nAnd even if the place is big or small\nAnd then she closed her eyes and put her hand on my chest\nAnd said ""I won\'t be a pest \'cause you know best""\nAnd then she opened her eyes, and went into in outburst\nAnd said ""Before you do anything, make love to me first""\nAnd don\'t give me that story that you ain\'t got time\n\'Cause we can go to your place or even mine\nSaid I\'d love to tell a story to all you young ladies\nWe got time now, let me park my Mercedes\n\'Cause I\'m gonna do it to the day I die\nThe Metropolitician will always satisfy\nTurn my head at your door and ask to come in\nAnd laid you down, we\'re going to do it again\nAnd when the feeling gets good I may not stop\nBecause I make sweet love just as good as I rock\nWell, let\'s rock y\'all, non stop, y\'all\nTo the beat, y\'all, the body rock, y\'all\nSo, let\'s rock y\'all, so, let\'s rock y\'all\nSo, let\'s rock y\'all so, let\'s rock y\'all1Embed', 'Spoonin Rap Lyrics(Intro)\nYou say\nOne for the treble\nTwo for the time\nCome on, y\'all, let\'s

I\'m the godfather\nI\'m the godfather\n\n[Verse 2]\nI cause silly young ladies to just chill\nThey never say no to me, always say that they will do\nWhenever I want them to, when I confront them to\nWatch where you\'re walkin\', or you just might bump into\nI never rule them, I only school them\nBut if they ever try to fool me, that\'s when I fool them\n[Chorus]\nI\'m the godfather\nI\'m the

and a bad attitude\nThat's all I need to get me in a good mood\nShe can walk with a switch and talk with street slang\nI love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing\nStanding at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop\nOnce she gets pumping, it's hard to make the hottie stop\nShe likes to dance to the rap jam\nShe's sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams\nHoney-coated complexion, using

neighborhood\n'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would\nYou're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk\nWant to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk\nWith your rayon, silk or maybe even denim\nIt really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em\nYou can break hearts and manipulate minds\nOr surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind\nYou always know what to say and do\nCold flip

It's a plane!”\nNo—I'm Su-Su-Super Rhymes\nIt’s the new thing, makes you want to swing\nWhile us MCs rap, doing our thing\nIt’s not singing, like it used to be\nNo, it’s rapping to the rhythm of the sure shot beat\nIt goes one for the money, two for the show\nYou got my beat, now here I go\nYou see, this DJ, he gets down\nMixing records while they go round\nWith the hid-dip, the hop, you just don’t stop\nYou rock to the beat ‘til it makes you drop\n\nYes, I’m one of a kind, I’m Super Rhymes\nAnd I’d like to say hello\nAnd since I’m on the mic and I’m ready to rock\nThis is how it goes\nYes, I rock so good, I rock so well\nI ring-ding-dang-a-ding-ding-a-dang, baby\nI'll ring your bell\nYes, I’m Super Rhymes, I’m twenty-two\nI want to be a hundred before I’m through\nBecause no, I didn’t come from the planet Earth\nPlanet Rhyme-on is my place of birth\nFrom the day I came out my mother’s womb\nI found myself in the operating room\nThen the doctor spanked me on my behind\nI didn’t cry, the kid started to rhyme\nMy mother said, “Son, that’s the way it should be\nYour name is Super Rhymes, you’ll be an MC”\nSo then my father put me on a meteorite\nSent me to Earth to rock the mic\nI got to Earth and started laying it down\nAt the jam on the mic, I could be found\nWhile I was at the jam this one time\nRocking to the beat, said I’m feeling fine\nJust-a freaking out on the freak’s behind\nI looked in the face of Frankenstein\nI said, “Oh, no, she’s not mine”\nBecause my woman is fine as wine\nAnd she goes by the name of Lois Line\nBut she didn’t come here with me this time\nI’m feeling real sad, but not that bad\nI’m-a have to run away from this crow-dad\nI ran to the deejay to rock the mic\nHe said, “Super Rhymes, take it, do what you like”\nSo I rocked the party viciously\nThis guy I didn’t know walked up to me\nBut the closer he got, the more I could tell\nIt was the man they call Coward Hosell\nThe guy you’d see on KBC\nWhile Joe Frazier boxed Muhammad Ali\nHe said, “Excuse me, sir, are you Super Rhymes?\nThe one with the fine woman Lois Line?”\nI said, “I am—will I be on TV\nLike the float-like-a-butterfly, stinging Ali?”\nHe said, “Yes, my man, if you show me you can\nI was told you had the master plan”\nSo I rocked the mic for Howard Cosell\nTo show America how I rocked so well\nAnd while I rocked the mic, this is what I said\nAbout Dracula, the living dead\nHe didn't like blood, not this vampire\nThe disco beat was his desire\nTransylvania’s where he made home\nUntil one day he decided to roam\nAnd then out of the crypt he did crawl\nCount Dracula is what he’s called\nHe said, “The sun's gone down, and now it’s night\nI'm going to spread my wings and take a serious flight\nI turned into a bat, I flew away\nI said at the disco is where I got to stay\nBecause back home, there was nothing like this\nIn Transylvania this is what I’d miss\nThey just bite necks and suck blood all day\nWhen I knew there had to be a better way\nI packed my coffin, said, ‘Vampires, I am leaving’\nSo I turned into a bat and cut out that evening\nThe first disco I hit was 54\nThey didn't even want to let me in the door\nI said, ‘Listen, my man, I am a real cool guy\nI can turn into a bat, I can even fly’\nHe said, ‘Dracula, you can do all of that\nThen come on in and catch a need-a freak attack’\nSo I went inside and I started to dance\nAnd had all the ladies waiting for their chance\nThey said, ‘Isn’t he cool with his widow’s peak\nAnd the strange way he does the Freak?’”\nHe said, “Where I come from it’s not called the Freak\nIts the Transylvania Boogie, seven days a week”\nI didn’t get to dance with them all that night\n'Cause at the break of dawn I saw sunlight\nI said, “I’m sorry to say I cannot stay\n'Cause us vampires must be in before it turns day\nBut don’t forget, I'll be back\nI like it when I catch a need-a freak attack\nAnd since you heard my story, it’s time I be leaving\nIn Transylvania we say ‘good evening’”\nMr. Hosell said, “Damn, that’s good\nYou’ll be on TV in every neighborhood”\nHe said, “Super Rhymes, you’re a real MC\nWe must put you on KBC”\nI said, I’ll dress to impress, won’t claim I’m best\nI’ll come a little better than all the rest\nBecause I never come with any less\nThan all the rhymes that will pass the test\nBecause I’m cool as ice, I’m twice as nice\nI never had an off-day in my life\nYou see, I take all your money, bust out your wife\nMake you dance to my beat all your life\n'Cause when I get in my stuff and I start to rhyme\nThe sucker MCs hide every time\nBecause my voice is baritone\nAnd I really don’t need no microphone\nBut I use one anyway\nTo make sure the ladies hear what I say\nAnd from here to there they hear my voice\nThe ladies hear me, I am their choice\nBecause my hair’s more wavy than there’s ships in the Navy\nAnd they use a boat to stay afloat\nTo put hickeys all over my throat\nBecause I am so cool…\nBecause I’m cool as snow, I’m like savoir-faire\nI’m the man you can find anywhere\nBecause I’m cooler than cold, I’m hotter than heat\nI rock to the rhythm of the funky beat\nBecause I got what it takes\nTo make everybody want to break\nYou see I got-a what it take\nI take it, make you want to break\nBreaker one (breaker one), breaker two (breaker two)\nI said-uh, this is what I want to say to all of you\nGo and telephone or tell a friend\nThe man known as Super Rhymes is back again\nAnd all you fly guys, I’ll tell you this\nI’ll take your fly girls with one kiss\nBecause I take the fly girls, put ‘em in check\nI got my love potion all around they neck\nThey’ve heard my voice and they know my name\nThey know within me there burns a flame\nThat I’m MC man headed straight for fame\nI got a Coupe DeVille, diamond rings\nI even got fur coats and gold plate things\n'Cause I’m the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour\nThe ladies know I’m the man with the power\nAnd now that you know a little more about me\nThis is how I rocked KBC\nYou see, deep in the desert, the city Baghdad\nAladdin was the boy, a magic lamp he had\nAladdin was to rub it and soon find out\nThat the lamp had magic and a genie, no doubt\nHe rubbed the lamp, the genie appeared\nBut you really couldn’t see him ‘til the green smoke cleared\nWell, the smoke was gone and there he stood\nThe tallest damn cat in the neighborhood\nHe said, “Where I come from I committed a crime\nFor every little thing you must serve time\nBut if my lamp was rubbed I’d be set free\nBut otherwise within the lamp I stay eternally\nAnd Aladdin, I say thanks to you\nYou rubbed my lamp, now my sentence is through\nAnd Aladdin, your wish is my command\nI’m sorry, but you only get three, my man”\nHe said, “Genie, my first wish would be\nTo go to the year 1980”\n”Hocus pocus,” said the genie, “I'll do that”\nAladdin looked around, saw where he was at\nHe said, “Damn, things aren’t the same\nI wonder if Aladdin is still my name\nBut it’s nice to be in ‘80\nAnd I got to say thanks to you, genie”\nHe said, “There’s nothing to it, I used to do it\nJust about everyday\nUntil I went to court, I got put in the lamp\nAnd the judge to take the spell away\nBut then you came along, made right my wrong\nYou rubbed my lamp and you set me free”\nHe said, “You used one wish, and you got two left\nAladdin, tell me what’s it going to be?”\nHe said, “Genie, in this society\nYou must have the green stuff called money”\nSo “hocus pocus” said the genie, “here’s a million bucks\nTo take it all with you here’s an armored truck”\n“Thanks,” said Aladdin, “Genie, you’re a real champ\nBut for a little while get back in your lamp”\nThe genie said, “Aladdin, yes, I’ll do that\nBut you got another wish, now I’ll be back”\nSo with a puff of smoke the genie was gone\nAladdin said, “A new millionaire is born”\nWell, with all that money he made more money\nAladdin was doing swell\nYou see, my man Aladdin, he got smart, you see\nInvested money into an oil well\nBut then one day he said, “I'm tired\nOf making the desert scene”\nHe said, “I got to get away, I got to go to the disco\nFind the freak of my dream”\nSo he took control of his private jet\nHis magic lamp and money he could not forget\nYes, he got to the disco, danced and screamed\nBut still couldn’t find the freak of his dream\nBut then she came, through the door\nThe baddest freak Aladdin said he ever saw\nHe said, “Wow! I got to get that girl!\nHer love is worth anything in the world”\nShe was a 38-24-35\nAladdin was attracted like a bee to a hive\nAladdin walked up, said, “Hello”\nShe looked him up and down and said, “You know where you can go”\nHe said, “Come on, baby, don’t play no game\nI’m called Aladdin, tell me, what’s your name?”\nWell, out of all the things Aladdin tried\nShe said, “Listen, sucker, take a carpet ride”\nAladdin said, “I know what to do\nI call on my genie with a spell for you\nSo then he rubbed the lamp, the genie came back out\nThe genie said, “Aladdin, what you’re fussing about”\nHe said, “Genie, I rocked, I said I’d be her man\nI tried to do it to her cause I thought I can\nIt was then that I met this girl\nWho said she wouldn’t freak me for nothing in the world”\nOut of all the things that Aladdin thought\nShe told him a body just couldn’t be bought\nSo Aladdin said, “At 4:50\nI know you’re coming to this bank with me”\nBut the freak told him no\nAnd my main man Aladdin, he told her so\nHe said, “I grab my partner do-si-do\nI spank her to the beat, but don’t let go\nUntil I hear her holler ‘yo, yo’”\nTo the beat, beat, check it out\nThe genie said, “Aladdin, I agree\nThis freak has got a vicious body\nBut that wish will be your last one\nAfter I do it, my job is done”\nThe genie said, “Your wish is my command\nShe’ll be your girl, you’ll be her man”\nSo he crossed his arms, said a magic word\nA “hocus pocus” is what you heard\nHe said, “Aladdin, she belongs to you\nTake her home and do what you want to do\nBut now it’s time that I leave\nI pull my magic carpet down out my sleeve\nI’m going to climb aboard, I’m going to fly away\nBack to Baghdad, that’s where I’ll stay”\nSo Aladdin looked up, said goodbye\nHe watched the magic carpet and the genie fly\nNow this is the end of this little tale\nIt’s time I keep rocking, the genie’s out of jail\nSo when I say “rock,” you say “roll”\nWhen I say “ice,” then you say “cold”\nThen when I say “disco,” you say “the beat”\nI say “it’s like honey,” then you say “it’s sweet”\nI say “rock”—“roll”\nI say “ice”—“cold”\nSay “disco”—“the beat”\n“Like honey”—“it’s sweet”\nNow you know my name, you know my game\nCompared to me there’s none the same\nBecause I got a funky groove, I'm going to make your body move\nBecause I got what it take-a-take to make you want to break-a-break-a\nBreaker one (breaker one), breaker two (breaker two)\nI said you heard my jam, now catch the boogaloo flu\n'Cause I'm Super Rhymes with disco\nI rock from here to Frisco\nI make you hate your video\nWhile I rock your mind in stereo\nSo kick off your shoes, relax your feet\nYou're going to move to my beat that sound so sweet\nBecause it's all of you I do adore\nAnd I got so much and more in store\nCause all through the day, through the night\nI sit down and new rhymes I write\nBecause this DJ, he gets down\nMixing records while they go round\nWith the hid-dip, the hop, you just don't stop\nYou bop to the beat till it makes you drop\nBecause I rock so good, I rock so well\nI ring-a-ding-a-dang-a-ding-ding-a-dang\nBaby, I ring your bell\nBecause I rock and roll\nIn ster-e-er-e-o\nI rock and roll\nIn ster-e-er-e-o\nLike Fred Flintstone said yabadabado\nYou hear my jam, want to yell it too\nBecause I got more rhymes than a clock chimes\nI got more rhymes than a monkey climbs\nI got more rhymes than a lemon and limes\nAnd I got more rhymes than a bank got dimes\nSo freak it to the east, freak it to the west\nI freak it to the girl with the biggest chest\nFreak it to the west, then you freak it to the east\nBut you never freak out with an ugly beast\nSo young ladies in the '80s\nCome and ride in my Mercedes\n'Cause the ladies see they all must stare\nBecause I got brown eyes and a wavy hair\nI'm not so tall, but I'm not so short\nAnd you young ladies are my favorite sport\nSo put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there\nYou put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there\nThen scream oh yeah—“oh yeah!” Oh what?—“oh yeah!”\nY'all, I'm leaving now, but I'll be back\nTo make the young ladies catch a need-a-freak attack\nYes, the time has come for me to leave the mic\nBut I'll be back with more of what you like\nSo…take a chillEmbed"", ""Money (Dollar Bill, Y’all) Lyrics[Hook x2]\nDollar bill ya'll, dollar bill

will find\nI rock the mic like one of a kind\nI roll through the street with my golden voice\nI got a gold Cadillac, a gold Rolls Royce\n[?] gettin\' shuffled around\nOr hanging in the best spots in town\nWhile I was headed uptown in my limousine\nI\'m watching myself on the TV screen\nI\'m dressed to the T with money in my pocket\nOr headed for a party to go and rock it\nWhen I looked out my window and to my surprise\nThere was a big butt girl with light brown eyes\nSo I went up to stake my claim\nI looked out my window and asked her name\nShe said ""I\'m not Roxanne, my name ain\'t Sue\nThey call me Angel and who are you?""\nI said ""I\'m twice as nice, I\'m cool as ice\nI\'ll make you dance to my beat for the rest of your life\nI\'m not being conceited or trying to bust\nBut a guy like me is gonna [?]\nI\'m getting to the point, you asked my name\nWell it\'s Jimmy Spicer, it\'s my claim to fame""\nShe said ""I heard your name and you rhyme before\nAnd all your records I do adore\nBut you trying to get some rap from me\nIt seems like some kind of fantasy""\nShe said ""Look at your car, you\'re known as a star\nIn a [?]""\nI said ""Gimme a try and take a chance\nYou might even like it if you [?] dance""\nSo come on girl and hang out with me\nEvery place we go you\'ll get in free\nSo she thought to herself and said okay\nI really didn\'t wanna go back around the way\nSo my chauffeur assisted her in the car\nI put a movie in my VCR\nAnd we drank champagne from my limousine bar\nWhen we got to the party I rocked you down\nWith my devastating, vicious sound\nI rocked the party, thought I\'d take her home\nI messed up her hair and then I gave her a comb\nAnd as she combed her hair, she said thank you\nYou rock everything like a real man do\nThe way you rock the mic you know you rocked me too\nYou rocked me until I was through\nI\'m really glad I took the chance\nYou made me dance and find romance\nSo I called my chauffeur to take her home\nI gave her my number, I said call me on the phone\nShe said before I go [?] life\nWill you please show me how you rock the mic\nI said my voice is [?], it\'s baritone\nI really don\'t need no microphone\nBut I use one anyway\nSo sucker MCs hear what I say\n[Outro]\nThis is it, y\'all\nSurely it, y\'all\nParty people in the place, don\'t quit y\'all\n\nThis is it, y\'all\nSurely it, y\'all\nParty people in the

about responsibility\nAnd I realize that everything I do\nIs affecting the people around me\nSo I wanted to take this time out\nTo apologize for things that I've done\nAnd things that haven't occured yet\nAnd things that they don't want to take responsibility for\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm sorry for the times that I left you home\nI was on the road and you were alone\nI'm sorry for the times that I had to go\nI'm sorry for the fact that I did not know\nThat you were sitting home, just wishing we\nCould go back to when it was just you and me\nI'm sorry for the times I would neglect\nI'm sorry for the times I disrespect\nI'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done\nI'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons\nI'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware\nThat you can't sleep at night when I am not there\nBecause I'm in the streets like every day\nI'm sorry for the things that I did not say\nLike how you are the best thing in my world\nAnd how I'm so proud to call you my girl\n[Chorus]\nI understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know\nAll the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show\nIf I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me\nI'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nYou could put the blame on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm sorry for the things that he put you through\nAnd all the times you didn't know what to do\nI'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags\nJust tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad\nWhen you would rather be home with all your kids\nAs one big family with love and bliss\nAnd even though pops treated us like kings\nHe got a second wife and you didn't agree\nHe got up and left you there all alone\nI'm sorry that you had to do it on your own\nI'm sorry that I went and added to your grief\nI'm sorry that your son was once a thief\nI'm sorry that I grew up way too fast\nI wish I would've listened and not be so bad\nI'm sorry that your life turned out this way\nI'm sorry that the feds came and took me away\n[Chorus]\nI understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know\nAll the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show\nIf I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me\nI'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me (Oh yeah)\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nYou could put the blame on me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm sorry that it took so long to see\nThat they were dead wrong tryna put it on me\nI'm sorry that it took so long to speak\nBut I was on tour with Gwen Stefani\nI'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt\nFor the embarrassment that she felt\nJust a little young girl tryin' to have fun\nHer daddy should've never let her out that young\nI'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down\nI hope they manage better next time around\nHow was I to know she was underage?\nIn a 21-and-older club they say\nWhy doesn't anybody wanna take blame?\nVerizon backed out, disgracing my name\nI'm just a singer tryin' to entertain\nBecause I love my fans I'll take that blame\n[Outro]\nEven though the blame's on you\nEven though the blame's on you\nEven though the blame's on you\nI'll take that blame from you\nAnd you can put that blame on me (On me)\nAnd you can put that blame on me\nYou can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)\nAnd you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)\nAnd you can put

vein and snatch your Adam's Apple\nJohn Madden-tackle your corpse\nTo hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle\nThat'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst\nThen curse tu vida like a Brujería

Bronson]\nBecause you treat me like shit\nI paid for the bed and never even slept in it\nI paid for that crib I never stepped foot in\nAnd now somebody else is eating all the pudding\nThings change, now my dashboard wooden\nAll black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden\nDark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy\nGirl, we grown, stop playin' on my phone, baby\nAll your childish attempts to make me angry fall short\nWhich only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing\nUnderstandable, I'm shinin' brilliant with five Brazilians\nThere were times I used to hide my feelings\nNow I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini\nAnd motherfuckers can't see me\nWait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy\nWho would've thought I hit you right back?\n[Chorus: Action Bronson]\nWhy you always all on my back?\nWhy you gotta do me like that?\nWhy you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?\nBaby girl, I'm blue\n\n[Verse 2: Action Bronson]\nSo many women wanna call me 'baby'\nAnd you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately\nSome would say that I'm the symbol for sex and, uh\nOthers would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath\nGo on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and, uh\nThat's me, and you could order whatever\nThe specialty is white snake and underwear sauce\nYou could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next\nAnd I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular\nI'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera\nAs Bocelli sings, the celly rings, I gotta go\nYou'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king\nI'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is\nI know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous\nStill, I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish\n\n[Chorus: Action Bronson]\nWhy you always all on my back?\nWhy you gotta do me like that?\nWhy you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?\nBaby girl, I'm blue\n[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]\nI hope you get a paper cut on your tongue\nFrom a razor in a paper cup\nI hope every soda you drink already shaken up\nI hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun\nI hope your titties all saggy in your early twenties\nI hope there's always snow in your driveway\nI hope you never get off Fridays\nAnd you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays\nI hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket\nI hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen\nI hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck\nAnd your headphones short, and your charger don't work\nAnd you spill shit on your shirt\nI hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face\nCut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade\nI hope you happy, I hope you happy\nI hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you

Lyrics[Part I: Dance with the Devil]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI once knew a nigga whose real name was William\nHis primary concern was makin\' a million\nBein\' the illest hustler that the world ever seen\nHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams\nA corrupted young mind at the age of 13\nNigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\nHer son\'s heart simultaneously grew colder\nHe started hangin\' out, sellin\' bags in the projects\nCheckin\' the young chicks, lookin\' for hit-and-run prospects\nHe was fascinated by material objects\nBut he understood money never bought respect\nHe built a reputation, \'cause he could hustle and steal\nBut got locked once and didn\'t hesitate to squeal\nSo criminals he chilled with didn\'t think he was real\nYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equal\nI don\'t project my insecurities on other people\nHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\nSo he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\nA feeble-minded young man with infinite potential\nThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental\nCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\nDancin\' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed\nBut he was sick of sellin\' trees and gave in to his greed\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin\' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin\' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there\'s always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God\'s angels that fell from the top\nThere\'s no diversity because we\'re burnin\' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo Billy started robbin\' niggas, anything he could do\nTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\nStartin\' fights over little shit up on the block\nStepped up to sellin\' mothers and brothers the crack rock\nWorkin\' overtime for makin\' money for the crack spot\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\nFulfillin\' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\nTired of the block niggas treatin\' him the same\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nBut when he tried to step to \'em, niggas showed him no love\nThey told him any motherfuckin\' coward can sell drugs\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\nBut only a real thug can stab someone \'til they die\nStandin\' in front of them, starin\' straight into their eyes\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\nSuggested rapin\' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\nSo now he had a choice between goin\' back to his life\nOr makin\' money with made men up in the cyph\'\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin\' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin\' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there\'s always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God\'s angels that fell from the top\nThere\'s no diversity because we\'re burnin\' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin\'\nSmokin\' blunts, drinkin\' and jokin\' for entertainment\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin\' alone\nThree in the mornin\', comin\' back from work, on her way home\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nWalkin\' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\n""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw""\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nScreamin\', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin\' around!""\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he\'d broken her jaw\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin\'\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin\'\nBlood leakin\' through the cloth, she cried silently\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\nRippin\' her up and chokin\' her until her throat burned\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren\'t concerned\nWhen they were done and she was lyin\'\nBloody, broken and bruised\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she\'d gone through\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\n[Sample]\nI\'m fallin\' and I can\'t turn back\nI\'m fallin\' and I can\'t turn back\n\n[Verse 4]\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nAnd he felt strong standin\' along with his new brothers\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\n\'Cause he was starin\' into the eyes of his own mother\nShe looked back at him and cried \'cause he had forsaken her\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin\' her\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn\'t even contemplate\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nWorkin\' hard for nothin\', because now what was he worth?\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nAnd cryin\' out to the sky, \'cause he was lonely and scared\nBut only the Devil responded, \'cause God wasn\'t there\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\nAnd listen, \'cause the story that I\'m tellin\' is true\n\'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\nIn fact, I\'m sure he\'s standin\' among one of you at my shows\nAnd every street cypher, listenin\' to little thugs flow\nHe could be standin\' right next to you, and you wouldn\'t know\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nWhite, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you\'re inflicted\nAnd you\'ll be one of God\'s children that fell from the top\nThere\'s no diversity because we\'re burnin\' in the melting pot\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never\nBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever\n[Part TII ""I""]\n[Intro: Immortal Technique]\nOh, y\'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?\nWell, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin\' back\nInto the grace of God and comin\' after you\nY’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shit\nYour fuckin\' A & R ain’t shit\nI’ll fuckin\' wipe my ass with your demo deal\nYo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!\n\n[Verse 1: Diabolic]\nGo ‘head and grip Glocks\nI’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots\nYou’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots\nI’ll watch you topple flat\nPut away your rings and holla back\nCan’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle caps\nBeneath the surface\nI’m overheatin\' your receiving circuits\nBy unleashin\' deeper verses than priests speak in churches\nWhat you preach is worthless\nYour worship defeat the purpose\nLike President Bush takin\' bullets for the secret service\nBeyond what y\'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap \'em\nShow no compassion, like havin\' a straight-faced orgasm\nTour jack \'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick\nIn the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist\nDiabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin\' cancer plague\nFist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin\' a hand grenade\nSo if I catch you bluffin\', faggot, you’re less than nothin\'\nI just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nYou motherfuckers are nothin\', you cannot harm me\nI’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army\nStorm the planet, huntin\' you down, \'cause I’m on a mission\nTo split your body into a billion one-celled organisms\nImmortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch\nYou’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix\nI’m \'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips\nArsenic language transmitted revolutionarily\nI’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably\nChemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece\nI’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece\nI’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin\' of dissin\' me\nAnd then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy\nThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology\nSo you’re nothin\', like diversity without equality\nAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology\nUsin\' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven\nProduces more digits than 22 divided by seven\nYou’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect\nYou never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin\' thug yet\nYour mind is empty and spacious\nLike the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist\nFace it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it\nLike children walkin\' through Antarctica, butt-naked169Embed', 'You Never Know Lyrics[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nShe was on her way to becomin\' a college graduate\nWouldn\'t even stop to talk to the average kid\nThe type of Latina I\'d sit and contemplate marriage with\nFuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire\nDisciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire\nFlyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez\nEveryone told me, kickin\' it to her was hopeless\nAt first I just thought she didn\'t mess with broke kids\nThe thug niggas always talkin\' about how they smoke kids\nBut the rich sniff-coke kids got no play\n""I\'m not even interested"" is what her body language would say\nEveryone around the way gave up tryin\' to get in it\nIt didn\'t matter how good your game was, she wasn\'t with it\nOn the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn\'t admit it\nTalk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it\nCause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it\nAnd no one ever gave them shit except McDonald\'s and did-dick\nSmokin\' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it\nShe spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin\' to copy\nBut when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy\nShe had a style, all her own, respectful and pure\nI was sick in the head for her, and there wasn\'t a cure\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon\'t you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it\'s all planned\nI\'m blessed just to know you\nI\'ve loved and I\'ve lost just to hold you all night\nCan\'t find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I\'d never let you go\nHold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nHer eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad\nI used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad\nThat I wasn\'t just another nigga tryin\' to get in it\nSo every now and then we\'d stop and talk for a minute\nI didn\'t have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours\nOn her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers\nThen I took her out to dinner after her cousin\'s baby shower\nWe talked about power to the people and such\nWe spent more time together, but it was never enough\nI never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel\nI was too interested in keepin\' it real\nPerfectly honest and complete\nShe would always call me ""cariño"" and never Technique\nBought me a new book to read every two or three weeks\nForever changin\' the expression of my thoughts when I speak\nIt was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks\nShe convinced me to stop hangin\' out on the streets\nTo stop robbin\' and stealin\' from people like you\nInstead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo\nMuseo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too\nGot to the point when I was either with her or my crew\nSo I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true\nI couldn\'t live without her, so I told her, facin\' my fears\nBut honey\'s only response was a face full of tears\nShe could only sob hysterically, holdin\' me tight\nI tried to speak, but she wouldn\'t stop until I left sight\nI felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light\nExcept I didn\'t burn, I turned cold after that night\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon\'t you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it\'s all planned\nI\'m blessed just to know you\nI\'ve loved and I\'ve lost just to hold you all night\nCan\'t find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I\'d never let you go\nHold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI went on with my life, college and my career\nEnded up locked up like an animal for a year\nWhere the C.O.\'s talk to you like they were the overseer\nThen I got sent to the hole when my exit was near\nAt night in my cell, I\'d close my eyes and I\'d see her\nHold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared\nJust an empty cell until the state gave me parole\nIn the summer, came back, intact and on track\nBut the fact of the matter is I still felt cold\nEven after my mother hugged me, cryin\' at home\nMy real niggas would catch me thinkin\', outta my zone\nFuckin\' lots of different women, but I still felt alone\nRelatively well-known around the New York underground\nBut I kept thinkin\' of her and how we used to be down\nThe sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair\nThough gone physically, somehow it was still there\nI had to do somethin\' because the shit was too much to bear\nSo I went and visited the building where she used to live\nThe world looks a lot different after you do a bid\nThe way your life done changed\nWhile primitive minds are still stuck in the same game\nLike her cousin who was on the corner, slangin\' cocaine\nStepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name\nHer mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta\nBut her facial expression changed\nWhen I asked about her daughter\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon\'t you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it\'s all planned\nI\'m blessed just to know you\nI\'ve loved and I\'ve lost just to hold you all night\nCan\'t find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I\'d never let you go\nHold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know\n\n[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]\nShe told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind\nAnd she had left it there waitin\' for such a long time\nI was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first\nI saw a tear swellin\' up in her eye, and then she cursed\nShe told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin\' the worst\nReversed my position, stepped over and opened the door\nAnd sure enough there was an envelope\nWith my name on the floor: ""Nobody loves you more than me, cariño,"" is what the letter said\n""By the time you get to read this, I\'ll probably be dead\nBut when you left in \'97, a part of me went to Heaven\nI thank God at least I got to know what love really was\nBut it hurt me to see what true love really does\n‘Cause even though we never made love\nYou were all that there was\nIt was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave\nYou made me doubt the way I thought\nYou made me want to believe\nAnd then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me\nIt was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me\nThis was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be\nBaby, don\'t you see?\nI had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV\nHope didn\'t exist for me since late in 1993\nI died a virgin, I wish I could\'ve given myself to you\nI cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you\nPromise that you\'ll meet me in Paradise inevitably\nNo matter what, I\'ll keep your love forever with me.""\nWhat happened for the rest of the day is still a blur\nBut I remember wishin\' that I was dead, instead of her\nShe was buried on August 3rd\nThe story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don\'t fuckin\' fall in love with people\nHold the person that you love closely if they\'re next to you\nThe one you love, not the person that\'ll simply have sex with you\nAppreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond\n‘Cause you never really know what you got until it\'s gone42Embed', ""The Point of No Return Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah, it's that real this time

They don\'t realize that America can\'t exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there\'s no way in hell we\'d allow this country to push it\'s genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed\nNiggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that\nThe problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it\'s not you who changes the system; it\'s the system that will eventually change you\nThere is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely And I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I\'ve been alive to know that it\'s a serious problem\nLatino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism\nYou see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials\nBut plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources\nI\'m quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words\nMy revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others\n\nYou see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America\nAside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States\nPlaces like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well\nAs different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we\'ll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined\nAnd that\'s why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques\nBut you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people\n""Fuck them, let them fend for themselves.""

I\'d rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I\'m really not, just to fit in\nAnd whether we want to accept it or not, that\'s what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us\nI want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn\'t have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We\'re given the idea that if we didn\'t have these people to exploit then America wouldn\'t be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living\nNo, that\'s wrong. It\'s the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money\nWe have whatever they kick down to us\nMy enemy is not the average white man, it\'s not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don\'t see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies\nThe generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real motherfuckers that I need to bring it to\nNot the poor, broke country-ass soldier that\'s too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up\nIn fact, I have more in common with most working- and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people\nAs much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue.\nMany of us are in the same boat and it\'s sinking, while these bougie motherfuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we\'re all in, we\'re gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole\nIn other words, I don\'t want to escape the plantation\nI want to come back, free all my people, hang the motherfucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground\nI want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land\nYou cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil\nI don\'t look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole\nMost of those successful individuals are sellouts and house negroes\nBut, I don\'t consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto\nPoverty has nothing to do with our people. It\'s not in our culture to be poor\nThat\'s only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture, and forms of government\nYou know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois League\nThe idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That\'s why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of White Spaniards once he was captured\nNot the Aztec people who would become Mexicans\nSo in conclusion, I\'m not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community and represent what\'s good for all of us proletariat\nPorque sino entonces te mando por el carajo cabron gusano hijo de puta, seramos libre pronto, viva la revolucion, VIVA LA REVOLUCION10Embed', 'Industrial Revolution Lyrics[Intro]\nThe day of the geechee is gone boy\nAnd you goin\' with it\nYeah, nigga\nImmortal Technique\nMetaphysics\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe bling-bling era was cute but it\'s about to be done\nI leave you full of clips like the Moon blocking the Sun\nMy metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch\nLike an escape tunnel in prison, I started from scratch\nAnd now these parasites want a percent of my ASCAP\nTrying to control perspective like an acid flashback\nBut here\'s a quotable for every single record exec\n""Get your fucking hands out my pocket, nigga!"" like Malcolm X\nBut this ain’t a movie, I\'m not a fan or a groupie and I\'m not\nThe type of cat you can afford to miss if you shoot me\nCurse the Heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me\nImmortal Technique stuck in your thoughts, darkening dreams\nNo one\'s as good as me—they just got better marketing schemes\nI\'ll lead you to your own destruction like sparking a fiend\n\'Cause you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream\nAnd that\'s the primary reason that I hate y\'all faggots\nI\'ve been nice since niggas got killed over 8-ball jackets\nAnd Reebok Pumps that didn\'t do shit for the sneaker\nI\'m a heatseaker with features that\'ll reach through the speaker\nAnd murder counter-revolutionaries personally\nBreak a thermometer and force-feed his kids mercury\nA&R\'s tried jerking me, thinking they call shots\nOffered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox\nYou\'re all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches!\n[Hook]\nThis is the business, and y\'all ain’t getting nothing for free\nAnd if you devils play broke, then I\'m taking your company\nYou could call it reparations or restitution\nLock and load, nigga.
