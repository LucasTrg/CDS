to admit that I used to draw\nPortraiture and the human form\nDoodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing\nMovin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond\nEven if it went beautifully wrong\nIt was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong\nNo name nuisance, stews in a bedroom\nOozing a brand-new cuneiform\nBarely commune with the horde\nGot a whole grayscale ungluing his world\nMight zone out to the yap of the magpie\nUnseen hand dragging his graphite\nCross contour, little bit of backlight\nBlack ink after a Bristol to baptize\nYou can't imagine the rush that ensue\nWhen you get three dimensions stuffed into two\nThen it's off to a school where it's all that you do\nBeing trained and observed by a capable few\nBack in New York, five peeps and a dog\nIn a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs\nPlus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod\nDistractions free to maraud\nI left some years a deer in the light\nI left some will to spirit away\nI let my fears materialize\nI let my skills deteriorate\nHaunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing\nA mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity\nIn rickety condition with an ID crisis\nNap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…\n[Hook]\nShapes falling out of the fringe\nAll heart, though we would've made cowardly kings\nThey will chop you down just to count your

your rings\nJust to count your rings, just to count your rings\n[Verse 2]\nUsed to paint\nHard to admit that I used to paint\nNatural light on a human face\nStenciled fire on his roommate's bass\nIt was blooming addiction\nAmiss in the pushing of pigment\nBook like a tattooed pigskin, look\nPinhead kids of the minute\nDrank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic\nAnd it grew up into linseed oil over linen\nJoy to the poison, voice of the resin\nCapture a map of the gesture\nBack up, add a little accurate fat to the figure\nRedo that, move that inward\nZinc white lightning shoots from his fingers\nStudio strewn with illusion and tinctures\nStay tuned for the spooky adventures\nYou can't imagine the stars that align\nWhen a forearm starts foreshortening right\nOr a torso hung on a warping spine\nIn proportion reads as warm and alive\nRoutine day with a dirt cheap brush\nThen a week goes by and it goes untouched\nThen two, then three, then a month\nAnd the rest of your life, you beat yourself up\nI left some seasons eager to fall\nI left some work to bury alive\nI let my means of being dissolve\nI let my person curl up and die\nEating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety\nHas brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy\nAligning with the trials of the anti-Midas\nNap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…\n[Hook]\nShapes falling out of the fringe\nAll

You are\nDivinity.  My primitive mind was struggling\nJust to understand the meaning of life, forgive me\nI never told my mommy, I couldn’t break her spirit.  She always\nWished her daughter extraordinary thinking, so I\nTraveled alone, young, sixteen, got in\nThe habit of not staying at home, doing the\nSad walk like Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty\nTrips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me\nI couldn’t eat shit.  I fainted frequent\nOn cold floors and I pause and I think, “Keep it”\nI’m lost.  My four friends know and just\nFuck at the boys’ apartments for rent, so I’m all\nWishing that it’s a dream ending soon.  I’ve actually\nErased a lot that I’ve been through\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nSee, when\nThe rain comes down\nI know it’s falling for me\nAnd only for me\nAnd when\nThe pain comes around, there’s nowhere\nElse I rather would be\nI know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)\n[Verse 2: Jean Grae]\nNow all my bitter homies saying, “That’s what men do.”  Feeling\nRetarded for seeing partner potential.  On top\nOf that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur.  I can’t\nTake it, I’m contemplating a Glock burner, a\nCop murderer.  I can’t leave.  This can’t be\nThe tears streaming, and I can’t see they lanced me\nAnd I’m passing out, and this is just for blood.  They had\nTo cover the mass amounts.  I’ve had enough\nAnd you don’t know what it’s like in waiting rooms, and out-\n-side, their picketing pictures could slay you\nThey’re screaming, “Victims,” and spitting ‘til they shame you\nI hold my head low and shiver, push my way through\nThey put you in a room where you can change into\nYour gown and shower cap, shaking as a fiend would do\nAnd that’s when you think of leaving, fleeing the building\nAnd then they call you and you’re hearing the call of your children\nThey count down from ten now.  You wanna stop ‘em, but\nYou say it in your head: you’re out for the cut\nAnd then you wake up in another room with plenty others\nThey call it recovery.  You’re thinking, “We ain’t mothers”\nAnd then prescription pills, written a ‘script with chills\nAn understatement.  You’re dressed but you’re naked still\nAnd your brain won’t think straight\nWait.  Can’t finish this\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nSee, when\nThe rain comes down\nI know it’s falling for me\nAnd only for me\nAnd when\nThe pain comes around, there’s nowhere\nElse I rather would be\nI know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)\n\n[Verse 3: Jean Grae]\nI kept it bottled up.  My parents found the pills\nScreaming, “God what have you done?”  Cried ‘til I snotted blood\nThen got a gun.  My temple ran quick though\nFrom the thought, then the worst: I was caught in the same place\nA year later.  For me, that’s when hatred started\nMy faith martyred.  I’ve dated the father of a father\nThen I moved on.  Years passed, the guilt’s\nWorse and it builds ‘til your heart’s smashed\nThen I miscarried.  Twenty-two age, I was headed to\nA breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down\nI was a failure at that too, bailed from\nThe rap then, but fate took me back in\n“Sing” is a tattoo my fingers attached with.  Twenty-seven\nWith three kids that I never met.  What if I\nWas Catholic?  Wonder if they hate me, thinking how\nTheir mother could ever murder?  Well take me, Hell\nTo the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly\nI am a monster, see.  How could I possibly\nCorrespond with God when I gave the authority\nTo end their life?\nBut it’s never over, even if we have a child\nThey could have had a brother or a sister or both\nI’m thinking about another life that almost got close\nPraying that, in another time, we could have changed posts\nIf I could just reverse time, I would\nI don’t know what I would do.

Alright, oh, uh, yeah, yeah.  I see you, love.  I said, “All the time.”  Does it ever puzzle you?  Have you asked why?  Nah.  I know I do.  I do, it’s true.  I ain’t pretending, man.  Aight, aight.

Out again\nDo you ever really love?\nOr just pretend?\nWhy fool yourself?\nDon’t be afraid\nTo help yourself\nIt’s never too late, too late to stop...\n\n[Bridge 2: Sample from Rodney Cee on Double Trouble - “Stoop Rap” with Scratches by Da Beatminerz] (x7)\nHere’s a little story that must be told\n\n[Verse 1: Jean Grae]\nShe grew up\nBelieving in passion and love, whose folks divorced and remarried\nVery naïve, seen life and commitments that\nShould have been dead and buried, highly sentimental, sensitive\nGentle beyond the point she should be.  What might be obvious\nTo most, she says they’re too bitter, can’t see\nThe world the way she does, clean lungs, undamaged liver, sees\nThugs through her pink-tinted glasses.  Occasionally, weed\nDoes make her giggle, listen to some music closer, dudes\nApproach her lightly, wanna be her lover, and she obliges\nLikes to cuddle under the covers by candlelit fires\nOblivious to lying schemes to talk her out of clothes, says\nShe’s just in love with love, cuts her classes, spends too much time\nEntrancing, romancing.  Things are changing quickly.  She’s asking\n“Why aren’t you spending more time with me?” Nigga’s eyes are getting\nShifty, coming over later smelling of pussy on his face\nJeans and sweaters—something’s fishy.  And it’s not what\nHe tells her, man, it’s what he don’t, and she don’t understand\nAnd, for some years, she probably won’t.  Just wants an honest man\nFor goodness sake, they’re backstabbing and cutting her throat\nRestraining orders follow, but she still optimistic about it\nLike Annie, thinking “Tomorrow” maybe will be a better day\nI let her pray on bended knees, ask him to send Prince Charming, please\nShe’s never cheated, treats her man well, cooks, cleans\nDresses sexy for him, halter tops and tight jeans, would break\nThe law for him, go through a couple of these relationships\nStill stays strong, she’s too young and dumb to call it quits\nLearns that she carrying twice, scared and afraid the first\nTime.  The second, she don’t even cry.  He makes her wipe away\nHis tears and it hurts.  They always leave and turn crazy, so\nShe doesn’t flirt, spends time warning the babies\nGoes through a couple of these relationships and still stays strong\nToo young and dumb to call it quits.  It’s still a love song\n[Verse 2: Jean Grae]\nShe’s got\nA good man.  She’s nineteen, he’s twenty-one and sweet and honest\nPromised to love her, talk of marriage. She would never wanna\nBe somebody’s baby’s mother, use rubbers occasionally\nWhen she’s flowing, open off the affection and gifts and all\nThe good manners he’s showing.  He’s trying to build a life for himself\nStudies late, computer shit, and she’s missing attention that\nShe’s not getting, sex dwindles.  Crawling in the sheets, he say\nHe tired, and she say she feel neglect and defeat, just doesn’t\nSee his ambition, she wanna be the universe and hold\nHis center position, starts hanging ‘round the best friend more\nCrazy attraction, takes impulsive action, dropped the drawers\nAnd falls in love, the world explodes when she confesses.  “Yeah, I did it\nSo?”  They’re so tight, it’s like he moves when she stretches.  Over\nThe couple years, too many stresses, girls who wanna fight her\nBitches writing letters, friendships disappearing, plus\nHe rhymes, so it’s competitive pressure, miscarriage.  They break up\nFifty times a week and make up just as much.  He fucking\nAnd I know, but pretending I’m out of touch.  It’s getting\nStrained and gets physical, she cries until the river dries\nAnd leaves her dead and cold, packs up her things and leaves behind.  What I\nHad thought was gold was only gold-plated.  Thinking of all\nThe other ones I could have just left and up and dated\nSingle after four years.  Starting over never easy, but it\nTakes some time to realize your own worth, come into\nYour own, play your mental rebirth.  She starts penning some\nBetter poems, straighten up her bank account, likes to take\nHerself out.  I’m getting better at it.  I’ve had\nA few relationships, but still too young and dumb enough to call\nIt quits.  It’s still a love song\n[Bridge 3: Jean Grae]\nLove\nAll I ever want is you\nAll I ever had\nNeeded in my life was you\nAll that ever was, all I ever had\n\n[Verse 3: Jean Grae]\nMaybe it’s\nEasier to talk about this shit in third person, learning\nBetter, looking for nub in all the wrong places like I’m\nEddie Murphy, curse me to repeat the same cycle I’m breaking\nNo longer think relations make a better woman, just\nFor life I’m pursuing, growing but hopelessly romantic still\nTasted weather in the bitter climates, love the sunshine better\nDreaming of dream proposals, decent moral values placing\nHigher on my chart, trying not to have a shallow heart\nBut battle scars are deep and reach into the depths of Hell and back\nTry to give up the grudges.  Think it’s experience\nAnd move from the clutches of sadness.  It’s difficult\nSometimes, I wish I wasn’t an adult.  Adolescent\nPrimetime sitcom star, I’ve been too far\nAnd too much, too hard for too long.  It’s still a love songEmbed']"

when it get overcast\nOld people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass\nAnd let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia\nSpread through Sudan and Egypt,

tell the Pope about herself\nJust after she left the Fugees, started rolling with the Marleys\nGot back with her crew at Dave Chapelle\'s Block Party\nShe made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful\nTook Black Star on tour in Europe, I was so grateful\nSpeaking for myself but I\'m sure I could speak for Dante\nI got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte\nWe used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer\nShe used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler\nParable of the Sower, the main character\'s name was Lauren\nWhat the album did for black girls\' self-esteem

pushed my brakes\nBecause I\'ve seen a fly girl, made me shiver and shake\nThen I blew my horn and she turned her head\nAnd to the young lady this is what I said\nI said: ""Baby, baby, Come on over to my car, and tell me your name so I can know who you are\nAnd just give me your number, address and all, I might wanna see ya, I might wanna call, your friend\'s house\nYour house, wherever you be,Meanwhile, baby doll, just come with me""\nSo I opened my door and she got into my car\nShe looked into my face and said ""I know who you are""\nShe said: ""I\'ve seen you once, I can\'t forget your face\nYou got style, got class, finesse and taste""\nI said: ""I\'m glad you think so, I\'m glad we met\n\'Cause I haven\'t met a girl nothing like you yet""\nJust lay on back and relax your head\nBecause the seat is so soft, just like a bed\nThen she looked at me and started to smile\nShe said ""Baby, lets have a little fun for a a while""\nI know every move from A to Z\nSo, if it\'s alright with you, it\'s alright with me\nBut if we do it in the car, that\'s no respect\nThen let\'s go to my house, she said ""It\'s a bet""\nAnd when I got her my house, I drove the female wild\nThe first thing she said is ""Let\'s have a child""\nI said: ""No, no, baby, I only got the time\nTo make a lot of money and to say my rhymes\nAnd if I had a baby, I might go broke\nAnd believe me, to me girl it ain\'t no joke\nPeople smile in your face and talk behind your back\nAnd you get the story, it\'s never exact\nSome say they\'re your friends but they really are not\nBecause they\'re only out to try to get what you got\nThey wanna hang out today, smoke cheeba and sniff coke\nThen they\'re ""See you later, alligator"" when you\'re broke\nBut you attract all the dudes and all the young ladies\nWith your diamond rings and your big Mercedes\nGold on your chest with your fine suit and clothes\n\'Cause that\'s the way the whole story goes\nNow you got your girl and you\'re doing the do\nBut every girl you see, you think she\'s made for you\nShe used to walk down the street, and never did speak\nNow she knows you got money at the tip of your feet\nAnd you\'re a sucker sucker dude for thinking you\'re slick\n\'Cause all you wanna do with the girl is trick\nYou can\'t lead yourself because you\'ve been led\nSee a young girl and it mess up your head\nAnd every time you look around, she\'s asking for your money\nShe thinks it\'s cool, she thinks it\'s funny\nIf you\'re smart you\'ll leave her, if you don\'t you stay\nBut if you do, you\'ll be a fool until your head turns grey\n\'Cause when your money is gone, believe me my friend\nThat those money-hawking girls gonna get in your way\nWhen you ain\'t got a dime, it ain\'t no joke\nAnd the girls you used to know, they call you Mr. Broke\nSo you better better learn from that one mistake\nAnd stop being a fool before it\'s too late\nI got a cure for all women, and hope you understand\nWhy they call me Spoonie Gee, the medicine man\nBecause I do it with greed and not too much speed\nSo, just take off your clothes, let me give you what you need\nMake you feel like a woman, with what I have to give\nBecause I\'mma be a lover for as long as I live\n\'Cause I\'m the S to the P, double O, N, Y, G\nThe perfect to serve for your ladies to see\nSo, fly guys, /, give the ladies a chance\nSee the King of Soul, the

time even though that\'s a lie\nAnd if you want my love, I give you all that I got\nFrom the bottom to the top and I won\'t get far\nBut just make sweet love \'til the sound is stopped\nIt\'s like an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\nYou can\'t get the feeling unless I\'m here with you\nIt takes two to tango and to make love too\nAnd when it comes to that, I\'m thinking of you\nWith your fine, silky body and your pearly white teeth\nAnd when I see you, baby, oh, what a relief\nFrom the girls I\'ve seen that end of a sore\nBut now I\'m with the one and only girl that I adore\nWith your pretty clear skin and your light brown eyes\nAnd your big derriere and your nice brown thighs\nSo, be very clever and stay mine forever\n\'Cause I\'d hate to lose you, baby, \'cause you\'re soft as a feather\nSo, don\'t make me beg you on my knee\nJust stay my main girl for a century\nI don\'t think I\'m bad, don\'t box or know karate\nI\'m just an MC to keep the boogie in the party\nWith you people on the floor\nGive you what you\'re bargaining for\nMake you all wanna dance until you can\'t no more\nNot a player, but a lover, like though I wrote\nAnd when it comes to the mic, I take complete control\nI never imitate, but I will appreciate\n\'Cause everything I do, you know it gotta be great\nSo, if you want to, party people, come on, no need to stall\nAnd if you wanna boogie, we can all have a ball\nPeople used to call me MC Spoony Spoon\nBut when I came to rock I didn\'t come too soon\nOne day a pretty lady came over to me\nAnd said ""Why don\'t you change your name\nTo MC

closed her eyes and put her hand on my chest\nAnd said ""I won\'t be a pest \'cause you know best""\nAnd then she opened her eyes, and went into in outburst\nAnd said ""Before you do anything, make love to me first""\nAnd don\'t give me that story that you ain\'t got time\n\'Cause we can go to your place or even mine\nSaid I\'d love to tell a story to all you young ladies\nWe got time now, let me park my Mercedes\n\'Cause I\'m gonna do it to the day I die\nThe Metropolitician will always satisfy\nTurn my head at your door and ask to come in\nAnd laid you down, we\'re going to do it again\nAnd when the feeling gets good I may not stop\nBecause I make sweet love just as good as I rock\nWell, let\'s rock y\'all, non stop, y\'all\nTo the beat, y\'all, the body rock, y\'all\nSo,

not lord, not prince\nI was a young kid rappin\', I\'ve been rockin\' ever since\nI was just a young buck, I didn\'t care what\nMCs were in my way, they never uttered a ""but""\n\n[Chorus]\n\'Cause I\'m the godfather\nI\'m the godfather\n\n[Verse 2]\nI cause silly young ladies to just chill\nThey never say no to me, always say that they will do\nWhenever I want them to, when I confront them to\nWatch where you\'re walkin\', or you just might bump into\nI never rule them, I only school them\nBut if they ever try to fool me, that\'s when I fool them\n[Chorus]\nI\'m the godfather\nI\'m the

don\'t diss me, just kiss me\nIf I ever had it and leave, you\'re gonna miss me\nI\'m just a brother, so what\'s up sis?\n\'Cause it\'s the pretty young ladies that make me talk like this\n\n[Chorus]\nYes I\'m the godfather\nI\'m the godfather\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey say that I\'m an MC, some say that I\'m a poet\nI changed my style, people just didn\'t know it yet\nI had to tell \'em,

you what I\'m about\nYoung ladies, no babies, and marriage is out\nBut if you insist, you can come get this\nYour house or mine, night or day\'ll be fine\nSo let\'s get with it, so that I can hit

fanatic at this, I\'m at the top of the list\nStay cool, don\'t break the rules unless you wanna get dissed\nRespect me while I\'m rappin\' on a record or show\nYou could stare \'cause I don\'t care, just as long you know\n[Chorus]\nThat I\'m the godfather\nYes I\'m the godfather\n\n[Verse 7]\nNow you\'ll be jumpin\', your heart\'ll be thumpin\'\nPlace\'ll be rockin\', sweat\'ll be poppin\'\nOff

didn’t cry, the kid started to rhyme\nMy mother said, “Son, that’s the way it should be\nYour name is Super Rhymes, you’ll be an MC”\nSo then my father put me on a meteorite\nSent me to Earth to rock the mic\nI got to Earth and started laying it down\nAt the jam on the mic, I could be found\nWhile I was at the jam this one time\nRocking to the beat, said I’m feeling fine\nJust-a freaking out on the freak’s behind\nI looked in the face of Frankenstein\nI said, “Oh, no, she’s not mine”\nBecause my woman is fine as wine\nAnd she goes by the name of Lois Line\nBut she didn’t come here with me this time\nI’m feeling real sad, but not that bad\nI’m-a have to run away from this crow-dad\nI ran to the deejay to rock the mic\nHe said, “Super Rhymes, take it, do what you like”\nSo I rocked the party viciously\nThis guy I didn’t know walked up to me\nBut the closer he got, the more I could tell\nIt was the man they call Coward Hosell\nThe guy you’d see on KBC\nWhile Joe Frazier boxed Muhammad Ali\nHe said, “Excuse me, sir, are you Super Rhymes?\nThe one with the fine woman Lois Line?”\nI said, “I am—will I be on TV\nLike the float-like-a-butterfly, stinging Ali?”\nHe said, “Yes, my man, if you show me you can\nI was told you had the master plan”\nSo I rocked the mic for Howard Cosell\nTo show America how I rocked so well\nAnd while I rocked the mic, this is what I said\nAbout Dracula, the living dead\nHe didn't like blood, not this vampire\nThe disco beat was his desire\nTransylvania’s where he made home\nUntil one day he decided to roam\nAnd then out of the crypt he did crawl\nCount Dracula is what he’s called\nHe said, “The sun's gone down, and now it’s night\nI'm going to spread my wings and take a serious flight\nI turned into a bat, I flew away\nI said at the disco is where I got to stay\nBecause back home, there was nothing like this\nIn Transylvania this is what I’d miss\nThey just bite necks and suck blood all day\nWhen I knew there had to be a better way\nI packed my coffin, said, ‘Vampires, I am leaving’\nSo I turned into a bat and cut out that evening\nThe first disco I hit was 54\nThey didn't even want to let me in the door\nI said, ‘Listen, my man, I am a real cool guy\nI can turn into a bat, I can even fly’\nHe said, ‘Dracula, you can do all of that\nThen come on in and catch a need-a freak attack’\nSo I went inside and I started to dance\nAnd had all the ladies waiting for their chance\nThey said, ‘Isn’t he cool with his widow’s peak\nAnd the strange way he does the Freak?’”\nHe said, “Where I come from it’s not called the Freak\nIts the Transylvania Boogie, seven days a week”\nI didn’t get to dance with them all that night\n'Cause at the break of dawn I saw sunlight\nI said, “I’m sorry to say I cannot stay\n'Cause us vampires must be in before it turns day\nBut don’t forget, I'll be back\nI like it when I catch a need-a freak attack\nAnd since you heard my story, it’s time I be leaving\nIn Transylvania we say ‘good evening’”\nMr. Hosell said, “Damn, that’s good\nYou’ll be on TV in every neighborhood”\nHe said, “Super Rhymes, you’re a real MC\nWe must put you on KBC”\nI said, I’ll dress to impress, won’t claim I’m best\nI’ll come a little better than all the rest\nBecause I never come with any less\nThan all the rhymes that will pass the test\nBecause I’m cool as ice, I’m twice as nice\nI never had an off-day in my life\nYou see, I take all your money, bust out your wife\nMake you dance to my beat all your life\n'Cause when I get in my stuff and I start to rhyme\nThe sucker MCs hide every

telephone or tell a friend\nThe man known as Super Rhymes is back again\nAnd all you fly guys, I’ll tell you this\nI’ll take your fly girls with one kiss\nBecause I take the fly girls, put ‘em in check\nI got my love potion all around they neck\nThey’ve heard my voice and they know my name\nThey know within me there burns a flame\nThat I’m MC man headed straight for fame\nI got a Coupe DeVille, diamond rings\nI even got fur coats and gold plate things\n'Cause I’m the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour\nThe ladies know I’m the man with the power\nAnd now that you know a little more about me\nThis is how I rocked KBC\nYou see, deep in the desert, the city Baghdad\nAladdin was the boy, a magic lamp he had\nAladdin was to rub it and soon find out\nThat the lamp had magic and a genie, no doubt\nHe rubbed the lamp, the genie appeared\nBut you really couldn’t see him ‘til the green smoke cleared\nWell, the smoke was gone and there he stood\nThe tallest damn cat in the neighborhood\nHe said, “Where I come from I committed a crime\nFor every little thing you must serve time\nBut if my lamp was rubbed I’d be set free\nBut otherwise within the lamp I stay eternally\nAnd Aladdin, I say thanks to you\nYou rubbed my lamp, now my sentence is through\nAnd Aladdin, your wish is my command\nI’m sorry, but you only get three, my man”\nHe said, “Genie, my first wish would be\nTo go to the year 1980”\n”Hocus pocus,” said the genie, “I'll do that”\nAladdin looked around, saw where he was at\nHe said, “Damn, things aren’t the same\nI wonder if Aladdin is still my name\nBut it’s nice to be in ‘80\nAnd I got to say thanks to you, genie”\nHe said, “There’s nothing to it, I used to do it\nJust about everyday\nUntil I went to court, I got put in the lamp\nAnd the judge to take the spell away\nBut then you came along, made right my wrong\nYou rubbed my lamp and you set me free”\nHe said, “You used one wish, and you got two left\nAladdin, tell me what’s it going to be?”\nHe said, “Genie, in this society\nYou must have the green stuff called money”\nSo “hocus pocus” said the genie, “here’s a million bucks\nTo take it all with you here’s an armored truck”\n“Thanks,” said Aladdin, “Genie, you’re a real champ\nBut for a little while get back in your lamp”\nThe genie said, “Aladdin, yes, I’ll do that\nBut you got another wish, now I’ll be back”\nSo with a puff of smoke the genie was gone\nAladdin said, “A new millionaire is born”\nWell, with all that money he made more money\nAladdin was doing swell\nYou see, my man Aladdin, he got smart, you see\nInvested money into an oil well\nBut then one day he said, “I'm tired\nOf making the desert scene”\nHe said, “I got to get away, I got to go to the disco\nFind the freak of my dream”\nSo he took control of his private jet\nHis magic lamp and money he could not forget\nYes, he got to the disco, danced and screamed\nBut still couldn’t find the freak of his dream\nBut then she came, through the door\nThe baddest freak Aladdin said he ever saw\nHe said, “Wow! I got to get that girl!\nHer love is worth anything in the world”\nShe was a 38-24-35\nAladdin was attracted like a bee to a hive\nAladdin walked up, said, “Hello”\nShe looked him up and down and said, “You know where you can go”\nHe said, “Come on, baby, don’t play no game\nI’m called Aladdin, tell me, what’s your name?”\nWell, out of all the things Aladdin tried\nShe said, “Listen, sucker, take a carpet ride”\nAladdin said, “I know what to do\nI call on my genie with a spell for you\nSo then he rubbed the lamp, the genie came back out\nThe genie said, “Aladdin, what you’re fussing about”\nHe said, “Genie, I rocked, I said I’d be her man\nI tried to do it to her cause I thought I can\nIt was then that I met this girl\nWho said she wouldn’t freak me for nothing in the world”\nOut of all the things that Aladdin thought\nShe told him a body just couldn’t be bought\nSo Aladdin said, “At 4:50\nI know you’re coming to this bank with me”\nBut the freak told him no\nAnd my main man Aladdin, he told her so\nHe said, “I grab my partner do-si-do\nI spank her to the beat, but don’t let go\nUntil I hear her holler ‘yo, yo’”\nTo the beat, beat, check it out\nThe genie said, “Aladdin, I agree\nThis freak has got a vicious body\nBut that wish will be your last one\nAfter I do it, my job is done”\nThe genie said, “Your wish is my command\nShe’ll be your girl, you’ll be her man”\nSo he crossed his arms, said a magic word\nA “hocus pocus” is what you heard\nHe said, “Aladdin, she belongs to you\nTake her home and do what you want to do\nBut now it’s time that I leave\nI pull my magic carpet down out my sleeve\nI’m going to climb aboard, I’m going to fly away\nBack to Baghdad, that’s where I’ll stay”\nSo Aladdin looked up, said goodbye\nHe watched the magic carpet and the genie fly\nNow this is the end of this little tale\nIt’s time I keep rocking, the genie’s out of jail\nSo when I say “rock,” you say “roll”\nWhen I say “ice,” then you say “cold”\nThen when I say “disco,” you say “the beat”\nI say “it’s like honey,” then you say “it’s sweet”\nI say “rock”—“roll”\nI say “ice”—“cold”\nSay “disco”—“the beat”\n“Like honey”—“it’s sweet”\nNow you know my name, you know my game\nCompared to me there’s none the same\nBecause I got a funky groove, I'm going to make your body move\nBecause I got what it take-a-take to make you want to break-a-break-a\nBreaker one (breaker one), breaker two (breaker two)\nI said you heard my jam, now catch the boogaloo flu\n'Cause I'm Super Rhymes with disco\nI rock from here to Frisco\nI make you hate your video\nWhile I rock your mind in stereo\nSo kick off your shoes, relax your feet\nYou're going to move to my beat that sound so sweet\nBecause it's all of you I do adore\nAnd I got so much and more in store\nCause all through the day, through the night\nI sit down and new rhymes I write\nBecause this DJ, he gets down\nMixing records while they go round\nWith the hid-dip, the hop, you just don't stop\nYou bop to the beat till it makes you drop\nBecause I rock so good, I rock so well\nI ring-a-ding-a-dang-a-ding-ding-a-dang\nBaby, I ring your bell\nBecause I rock and roll\nIn ster-e-er-e-o\nI rock and roll\nIn ster-e-er-e-o\nLike Fred Flintstone said yabadabado\nYou hear my jam, want to yell it too\nBecause I got more rhymes than a clock chimes\nI got more rhymes than a monkey climbs\nI got more rhymes than a lemon and limes\nAnd I got more rhymes than a bank got dimes\nSo freak it to the east, freak it to the west\nI freak it to the girl with the biggest chest\nFreak it to the west, then you freak it to the east\nBut you never freak out with an ugly beast\nSo young ladies in the '80s\nCome and ride in my Mercedes\n'Cause the ladies see they all must stare\nBecause I got brown eyes and a wavy hair\nI'm not so tall, but I'm not so short\nAnd you young ladies are my favorite sport\nSo put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there\nYou put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there\nThen scream oh yeah—“oh yeah!” Oh what?—“oh yeah!”\nY'all, I'm leaving now, but I'll be back\nTo make the young ladies catch a need-a-freak attack\nYes, the time has come for me to leave the mic\nBut I'll be back with more of what you like\nSo…take a chillEmbed"", ""Money (Dollar Bill, Y’all) Lyrics[Hook x2]\nDollar bill ya'll, dollar bill

Bronson]\nBecause you treat me like shit\nI paid for the bed and never even slept in it\nI paid for that crib I never stepped foot in\nAnd now somebody else is eating all the pudding\nThings change, now my dashboard wooden\nAll black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden\nDark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy\nGirl, we grown, stop playin' on my phone, baby\nAll your childish attempts to make me angry fall short\nWhich only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing\nUnderstandable, I'm shinin' brilliant with five Brazilians\nThere were times I used to hide my feelings\nNow I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini\nAnd motherfuckers can't see me\nWait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy\nWho would've thought I hit you right back?\n[Chorus: Action Bronson]\nWhy you always all on

uh\nThat's me, and you could order whatever\nThe specialty is white snake and underwear sauce\nYou could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next\nAnd I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular\nI'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera\nAs Bocelli sings, the celly rings, I gotta go\nYou'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king\nI'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is\nI know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous\nStill, I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish\n\n[Chorus: Action

twenties\nI hope there's always snow in your driveway\nI hope you never get off Fridays\nAnd you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays\nI hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket\nI

Lyrics[Part I: Dance with the Devil]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI once knew a nigga whose real name was William\nHis primary concern was makin\' a million\nBein\' the illest hustler that the world ever seen\nHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams\nA corrupted young mind at the age of 13\nNigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\nHer son\'s heart simultaneously grew colder\nHe started hangin\' out, sellin\' bags in the projects\nCheckin\' the young chicks, lookin\' for hit-and-run prospects\nHe was fascinated by material objects\nBut he understood money never bought respect\nHe built a reputation, \'cause he could hustle and steal\nBut got locked once and didn\'t hesitate to squeal\nSo criminals he chilled with didn\'t think he was real\nYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equal\nI don\'t project my insecurities on other people\nHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\nSo he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\nA feeble-minded young man with infinite potential\nThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental\nCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\nDancin\' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed\nBut he was sick of sellin\' trees and gave in to his greed\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin\' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin\' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there\'s always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God\'s angels that fell from the top\nThere\'s no diversity because we\'re burnin\' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo Billy started robbin\' niggas, anything he could do\nTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\nStartin\' fights over little shit up on the block\nStepped up to sellin\' mothers and brothers the crack rock\nWorkin\' overtime for makin\' money for the crack spot\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\nFulfillin\' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\nTired of the block niggas treatin\' him the same\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nBut when he tried to step to \'em, niggas showed him no love\nThey told him any motherfuckin\' coward can sell drugs\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\nBut only a real thug can stab someone \'til they die\nStandin\' in front of them, starin\' straight into their eyes\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\nSuggested rapin\' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\nSo now he had a choice between goin\' back to his life\nOr makin\' money with made men up in the cyph\'\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin\' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin\' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there\'s always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God\'s angels that fell from the top\nThere\'s no diversity because we\'re burnin\' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin\'\nSmokin\' blunts, drinkin\' and jokin\' for entertainment\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin\' alone\nThree in the mornin\', comin\' back from work, on her way home\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nWalkin\' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\n""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw""\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nScreamin\', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin\' around!""\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he\'d broken her jaw\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin\'\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin\'\nBlood leakin\' through the cloth, she cried silently\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\nRippin\' her up and chokin\' her until her throat burned\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren\'t concerned\nWhen they were done and she was lyin\'\nBloody, broken and bruised\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she\'d gone through\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\n[Sample]\nI\'m fallin\' and I can\'t turn back\nI\'m fallin\' and I can\'t turn back\n\n[Verse 4]\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nAnd he felt strong standin\' along with his new brothers\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\n\'Cause he was starin\' into the eyes of his own mother\nShe looked back at him and cried \'cause he had forsaken her\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin\' her\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn\'t even contemplate\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nWorkin\' hard for nothin\', because now what was he worth?\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nAnd cryin\' out to the sky, \'cause he was lonely and scared\nBut only the Devil responded, \'cause God wasn\'t there\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\nAnd listen, \'cause the story that I\'m tellin\' is true\n\'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\nIn fact, I\'m sure he\'s standin\' among one of you at my shows\nAnd every street cypher, listenin\' to little thugs flow\nHe could be standin\' right next to you, and you wouldn\'t know\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nWhite, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you\'re inflicted\nAnd you\'ll be one of God\'s children that fell from the top\nThere\'s no diversity because we\'re burnin\' in the melting pot\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say

then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy\nThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology\nSo you’re nothin\', like diversity without equality\nAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology\nUsin\' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven\nProduces more digits than 22 divided by seven\nYou’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect\nYou never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin\' thug yet\nYour mind is empty and spacious\nLike the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist\nFace it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it\nLike

average kid\nThe type of Latina I\'d sit and contemplate marriage with\nFuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire\nDisciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire\nFlyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez\nEveryone told me, kickin\' it to her was hopeless\nAt first I just thought she didn\'t mess with broke kids\nThe thug niggas always talkin\' about how they smoke kids\nBut the rich sniff-coke kids got no play\n""I\'m not even interested"" is what her body language would say\nEveryone around the way gave up tryin\' to get in it\nIt didn\'t matter how good your game was, she wasn\'t with it\nOn the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn\'t admit it\nTalk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it\nCause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it\nAnd no one ever gave them shit except McDonald\'s and did-dick\nSmokin\' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it\nShe spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin\' to copy\nBut when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy\nShe had a style, all her own, respectful and pure\nI was sick in the head for her, and there wasn\'t a cure\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon\'t you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it\'s all planned\nI\'m blessed just to know you\nI\'ve loved and I\'ve lost just to hold you all night\nCan\'t find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I\'d never let you go\nHold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nHer eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad\nI used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad\nThat I wasn\'t just another nigga tryin\' to get in it\nSo every now and then we\'d stop and talk for a minute\nI didn\'t have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours\nOn her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers\nThen I took her out to dinner after her cousin\'s baby shower\nWe talked about power to the people and such\nWe spent more time together, but it was never enough\nI never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel\nI was too interested in keepin\' it real\nPerfectly honest and complete\nShe would always call me ""cariño"" and never Technique\nBought me a new book to read every two or three weeks\nForever changin\' the expression of my thoughts when I speak\nIt was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks\nShe convinced me to stop hangin\' out on the streets\nTo stop robbin\' and stealin\' from people like you\nInstead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo\nMuseo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too\nGot to the point when I was either with her or my crew\nSo I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true\nI couldn\'t live without her, so I told her, facin\' my fears\nBut honey\'s only response was a face full of tears\nShe could only sob hysterically, holdin\' me tight\nI tried to speak, but she wouldn\'t stop until I left sight\nI felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light\nExcept I didn\'t burn, I turned cold after that night\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon\'t you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it\'s all planned\nI\'m blessed just to know you\nI\'ve loved and I\'ve lost just to hold you all night\nCan\'t find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I\'d never let you go\nHold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI went on with my life, college and my career\nEnded up locked up like an animal for a year\nWhere the C.O.\'s talk to you like they were the overseer\nThen I got sent to the hole when my exit was near\nAt night in my cell, I\'d close my eyes and I\'d see her\nHold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared\nJust an empty cell until the state gave me parole\nIn the summer, came back, intact and on track\nBut the fact of the matter is I still felt cold\nEven after my mother hugged me, cryin\' at home\nMy real niggas would catch me thinkin\', outta my zone\nFuckin\' lots of different women, but I still felt alone\nRelatively well-known around the New York underground\nBut I kept thinkin\' of her and how we used to be down\nThe sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair\nThough gone physically, somehow it was still there\nI had to do somethin\' because the shit was too much to bear\nSo I went and visited the building where she used to live\nThe world looks a lot different after you do a bid\nThe way your life done changed\nWhile primitive minds are still stuck in the same game\nLike her cousin who was on the corner, slangin\' cocaine\nStepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name\nHer mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta\nBut her facial expression changed\nWhen I asked about her daughter\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon\'t you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it\'s all planned\nI\'m blessed just to know you\nI\'ve loved and I\'ve lost just to hold you all night\nCan\'t find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I\'d never let you go\nHold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know\n\n[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]\nShe told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind\nAnd she had left it there waitin\' for such a long time\nI was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first\nI saw a tear swellin\' up in her eye, and then she cursed\nShe told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin\' the worst\nReversed my position, stepped over and opened the door\nAnd sure enough there was an envelope\nWith my name on the floor: ""Nobody loves you more than me, cariño,"" is what the letter said\n""By the time you get to read this, I\'ll probably be dead\nBut when you left in \'97, a part of me went to Heaven\nI thank God at least I got to know what love really was\nBut it hurt me to see what true love really does\n‘Cause even though we never made love\nYou were all that there was\nIt was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave\nYou made me doubt the way I thought\nYou made me want to believe\nAnd then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me\nIt was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me\nThis was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be\nBaby, don\'t you see?\nI had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV\nHope didn\'t exist for me since late in 1993\nI died a virgin, I wish I could\'ve given myself to you\nI cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you\nPromise that you\'ll meet me in Paradise inevitably\nNo matter what, I\'ll keep your love forever with me.""\nWhat happened for the rest of the day is still a blur\nBut I remember wishin\' that I was dead, instead of her\nShe was buried on August 3rd\nThe story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don\'t fuckin\' fall in love with people\nHold the person that you love closely if they\'re next to you\nThe one you love, not the person that\'ll simply have sex with you\nAppreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond\n‘Cause you never really know what you got until it\'s gone42Embed', ""The Point of No Return Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah, it's that real this time
