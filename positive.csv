But when I watched it again at age sixteen (when they were up to Day of the Dead), I\'d gotten knowledge of myself, and could relate to what it was saying about America. The dead were alive but they were blind, deaf, and dumb. So to me, they were symbolic of black men in America.","\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Secondly, Dawn of the Dead was the great metaphor for American society. The zombies were Americans, just walking through the mall, lost, trying to find excitement outside of themselves. They forgot that excitement is not buying a new TV; it\'s taking your shoes off and walking in the grass in your backyard. All those movies were really showing us ourselves.","\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The dead in those movies are alive--that\'s just a description of physical matter, it\'s active--but they don\'t have life.

We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the well-being of the people; it's only about profit. Everything else—their image, their human resources, their public relations—only exist to protect the reality behind it. Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us, and so they privatized everything. Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart. They didn't care about our survival or well-being—they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources. They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism, and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them. Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy, and that we would have freedom, but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom, the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table. Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God",,,0.0,0.0,1.0,2011.0
4081,2010.0,0.0,America,4081,Immortal Technique,Open Your Eyes,2011-10-27,"And while some used missionaries and donations to off-set this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease, and sanctions that killed millions. They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enabled them, and stored them and kept them in power. They became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, governments of thievery. They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits. The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy, and even overthrow democratically elected governments. And so the age of revolution began again. They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market. But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself. It is manipulated like a puppet, and it survives because of its image. Destroy the image, and the enemy will die. Such is the same in the rap industry. But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World. When they need new assets, new artists to prostitute a side-ins, and put on a shelf to use their songs; when they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the Third World. They took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us. But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need them to succeed. They're no better than us. Their economic advertising was always a lie. A few got rich, but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure. Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelry, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide genes, 20-year contracts, and oil blood money. Build your defenses, my independent brothers and sisters. They’ll stop at nothing to get what they want. They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward. But the super powers are no less corrupt; they've just learned to disguise it better, ‘cause they fix elections too, they embezzle tax money, they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit. And when there's enough at stake, history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own presidents",,,0.0,0.0,1.0,2011.0

I hit the streets for the same reason a lot of other kids do: I wanted money and excitement and liked the idea of cutting myself loose from the rules and low ceilings of the straight world. The truth is that most kids on the corner aren't making big money--especially if you break their income down into hourly wage.* But they're getting rewarded in ways that go beyond dollars and cents. The kid on the streets is getting a shot at a dream. The dream is that he will be the only one to make this hustling thing pay off in a big way. He sees the guy who gets rich and drives the nice car and thinks, yep, that'll be me. He ignores the other stories going around, about dudes who get shot or beaten to death with bricks and chains. But they're working that corner for more than whatever small cut they get of the crack they sell--they're working because they're due for a miracle. The kid in McDonald's gets a check and that's it. There's no dream in fast food. Manager? That's a promotion not a dream. It took me a long time to realize how much courage it took to work at McDonald's, to walk through the streets past rows of hustlers wearing that orange uniform. But at the time, it seemed like an act of surrender to a world that hated us. I never even considered it a possibility.","--Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner,  Freakonomics1Embed"", ""Decoded: Part 3 (Excerpts) LyricsPart 3: POLITICS As USUAL Poor people in general have a twisted relationship with the government. We're aware of the government from the time we're born. We live in government-funded housing and work government jobs. We have family and friends spending time in the ultimate public housing, prison. We grow up knowing people who pay for everything with little plastic cards — Medicare cards for checkups, EBT cards for food. We know what AFDC and WIC stand for and we stand for hours waiting for bricks of government cheese. The first and fifteenth of each month are times of peak economic activity. We get to know all kinds of government agencies not because of civics class, but because they actually visit our houses and sit up on our couches asking questions. From the time we're small children we go to crumbling public schools that tell us all we need to know about what the government thinks of us.",0.16,0.12,0.72,2002.0

He mentioned he had family and brothers in Staten Island that were putting this movement together, this Wu-Tang thing. So one day he invites me to go to the studio with him. I didn\'t go because I had to go to night school that evening. So the next day he had a tape of what they did the night before. And that tape was an unfinished version of ""Protect Yo Neck."" When I heard that, everything just became crystal clear now. I never missed another studio session after that. Whenever he told me he was going somewhere I was there. It inspired me to sit down. Let me just see if I can write something. I\'ve never written a rhyme before this. So that\'s what I did.

4058,2000.0,0.0,America,4058,Immortal Technique,Hollywood Drive By,2003-11-18,"To think about the origins of hip-hop in this culture and also about Homeland Security is to see that there are, at the very least, two worlds in America: one of the well-to-do and another of the struggling. For if ever there was the absence of homeland security, it is seen in the gritty roots of hip-hop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty. In the broader society, the opposite is true, for here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so widespread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. Their very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence, or the U.S Department of Justice. They're just words, they have very little relationship to reality. Now do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon?

I am here--not as a teacher, nor expert, nor genius--but rather as a science enthusiast who wants to inspire New York City public high school students to get excited about biology, chemistry and physics. I wish there had been a more compelling way to captivate my imagination about science when I was in school",,"The interaction between matter and energy has always aroused my interest and curiosity. When I was around the age of six, I can remember playing with two pieces of steel or metal. One of them was magnetic and the other was not. The piece with the magnetic force attracted the piece without. I flipped them in opposite directions and they repelled each other as if some force was pushing them apart. I found this fascinating. Years later I would come to learn that every single atom in your body is from the core of a star that was created billions of years ago. From the skin cells to the iron in your blood, the carbon in your genes to the gold on your finger, all created over thirteen billion years ago.

The piece with the magnetic force attracted the piece without. I flipped them in opposite directions and they repelled each other as if some force was pushing them apart. I found this fascinating. Years later I would come to learn that every single atom in your body is from the core of a star that was created billions of years ago. From the skin cells to the iron in your blood, the carbon in your genes to the gold on your finger, all created over thirteen billion years ago.

I am here--not as a teacher, nor expert, nor genius--but rather as a science enthusiast who wants to inspire New York City public high school students to get excited about biology, chemistry and physics. I wish there had been a more compelling way to captivate my imagination about science when I was in school",,"The interaction between matter and energy has always aroused my interest and curiosity. When I was around the age of six, I can remember playing with two pieces of steel or metal. One of them was magnetic and the other was not. The piece with the magnetic force attracted the piece without. I flipped them in opposite directions and they repelled each other as if some force was pushing them apart. I found this fascinating. Years later I would come to learn that every single atom in your body is from the core of a star that was created billions of years ago. From the skin cells to the iron in your blood, the carbon in your genes to the gold on your finger, all created over thirteen billion years ago. Not only is that an interesting connection, it is also a great one.

I left high school in the tenth grade and it\'s one of my greatest regrets in life. I am here--not as a teacher, nor expert, nor genius--but rather as a science enthusiast who wants to inspire New York City public high school students to get excited about biology, chemistry and physics. I wish there had been a more compelling way to captivate my imagination about science when I was in school",,"The interaction between matter and energy has always aroused my interest and curiosity. When I was around the age of six, I can remember playing with two pieces of steel or metal. One of them was magnetic and the other was not. The piece with the magnetic force attracted the piece without. I flipped them in opposite directions and they repelled each other as if some force was pushing them apart. I found this fascinating. Years later I would come to learn that every single atom in your body is from the core of a star that was created billions of years ago. From the skin cells to the iron in your blood, the carbon in your genes to the gold on your finger, all created over thirteen billion years ago. Not only is that an interesting connection, it is also a great one.

And what I mean we can take anything we want, we can take, we can have anything, because it belongs to you. If you\'re right and you got, good on your side, I really truly believe that nothing can stop you. And I\'m using the same thing as America taught me. That\'s what I\'m using the tools of this country, Capitalism and imperialism, colon-ism, I\'m using all those against them, and that\'s what they hate. They hate to see a little black kid sit in a first class with a gang in gold chains, gold rings you know what I\'m saying. The stewards staring at me .. they hate that.. they hate that shit so bad. They hate when I get off the plane and they lugging they luggage to go find a cab and I gotta car waiting for me with my name real  big, big African name ""Tupac"" they hate that I see it in their eyes. They hate that; when they see me in the restaurant or something wit a girl it\'s a black woman and I\'m sitting next to they hate that.. they hate.. they really hate when it\'s a white woman, but they won\'t see it.. they won\'t.. not from Tupac. So they hate that they see me with black woman they hate I don\'t say bitch, you know what I\'m saying?, to black females. I say bitch to white cops and the crooked cops that\'s who I say bitch to that\'s who is a bitch they hate that. They hate that; they can\'t limit me and hold me in one circle. They hate every time they tryna put me in gangsta category. I flip, do a summer song and end up in a juice category and I love that. I love that about myself, and I love that about black people. And If I can love... I\'m loving myself. I remember when I was poor I hated myself, now I love myself. So I see what the curse can do, and I see what it takes to get it off you. It just takes a little confidence, and that\'s what we missing as black people. We let them make us feel like you know, a quiet again. Just being a quiet, you know what I\'m saying, telling you that when good chains is hoochie. And that\'s played out, cause they make jokes about it. You know boohubhubahubhuba, really! They ain\'t got no rhythm, so what they can tell me, how can they joke about buhubahuba and they ain\'t got no rhythm, you know what I\'m saying. How they gon\' joke about me wearing gold chains. And they wearing a fuckin cougar skin, they wearing animal skin. and it\'s 20 you know it\'s hot, they wearing animal\'s furs and shit. How can they tell me about surviving on this planet and I\'ve been here longer? And I can walking the sun with me with no problems.. for as long as I want I can enjoy the air for as long as I want and they can\'t ..something is wrong there is a difference for us to say we all equal, we are equal in terms of the rights that we should giving but every body is different, everybody is unique, and you have to give black people their credit, just like we give white people their credits.",just like we can do anything... we can do that.. not not I\'m not saying this.

Peace to all, fear none, this is Yasiin Bey. At this present time, I am currently in Cape Town, South Africa, and I\'m being prevented from leaving, unjustly, unlawfully, and without any logical reason. They\'re saying that they want to deport my family. Uh, they\'re making false claims against me, some of these government officials, even in the press are making false claims against me, saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious, which it is not. Anyone can do the research about the world passport; it\'s not a fictitious document. It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nation\'s state, at all. In fact, the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa, in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. You can see the stamps; they\'re there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate. To quote Lil Durk, I am not a liar. I\'ve made no false claims. I have not misrepresented myself. I\'m under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny, and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way I\'m being treated, because this is following no reasonable train of logic, as also, um...It\'s curious. I haven\'t broken any law, and I\'m being treated like a criminal. I know I\'m not unique in that regard, and I am grateful that I\'m here with my family. I haven\'t been physically harmed or anything like that. However, I have been detained. People in this state have taken punitive action against me, unnecessarily. There\'s no reason I have to spend any time in the cell. There\'s no reason I had to have police come to my house, damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport, where nobody arrested me, and none of that ever happened, at all. This is not an administration of justice, and all I seek is to leave the state. I\'m not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that. People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing, because I\'m not- I just wanna go home, and I don\'t live in America, and I have the right to domicile wherever I please, without fear or without interference",No more parties in SA,,0.365,0.269,0.366,

Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac\'s – excuse me – Makaveli\'s verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.

More than ever right now, people are interested in artists from other countries – what’s going on in Australia, what’s going on with artists in Paris, what’s going on with artists in London. We’ve had this thing in America for so long where we play our artists over here and maybe if you get hot enough over there, we’ll let you come over. The world doesn’t work like that. It’s in real-time right now. And that’s the start. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And we feel like, if we can do that good and, most importantly, every half an hour, report the news and report it quicker than it can be put up on a blog, we will build that currency with people and when they think about music, they think about Revolt and to me, that is more important than that one particular show.",,,0.0,0.0,1.0,

Instead of throwing out the Baby with the bath water, we do well to expose the intentionally poisoned water the Baby has been forced to soak in since its origin in these lands. America’s particular brand of hypocrisy is gross (double entendre).","If we took all of what we deem horrible regarding the criminal abuses that black people have committed over this country’s history, and add it all up, it still does not compare to the hundreds of years of terrorism, violent domination, theft, rape, abuse, captivity, and beyond that black people have suffered under the ideologies and systems of white supremacy, racism, and slave based paradigms. I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse. How then does the chief offender become the judge? Might does not necessarily mean right. Right is right. People forcibly reduced to sub-human existences, so that they behave in sub-human ways, helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity. People, like plants, grow where the light is. When you enclose a plant and limit its light source, it will bend itself toward the light, for the light is necessary for its survival. This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them, survival then forces them to twist and/or bend toward the only way of escape.",,0.062,0.224,0.714,
